It was interesting to see Lovefilm recently reveal that its streaming business had overtaken its physical DVD, Blu-ray and game rentals for the [first time](http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/lovefilm-streaming-overtakes-dvd-rentals-for-first-time-1073038).  While it may still be a bit too early to write the obituary for physical media, announcements like this make it clear that times are changing - and I for one won't be shedding any tears.

For someone who has moved house a number of times over the last 10 years, I have noticed the number of CDs, DVDs and for a time VHS video tapes (remember them?) I own steadily decreases each time. Technology has made rapid leaps forward in recent years, making it easier than ever to listen to the latest album or watch the latest Hollywood blockbuster or popular TV series online.  So where once regular trips to HMV would be in order to make physical purchases, my media needs can now be met virtually by the likes of iTunes, Netflix and Sky Anytime+ - and as highlighted by [HMV’s financial problems](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9027949/HMV-banks-give-struggling-retailer-breathing-space.html) in recent times, it seems I am not alone.

It isn't just with films and music where we are seeing this change.  Increasingly, games manufacturers are making their titles available to download as it is a cheaper alternative than selling physical discs.  For example, for the first time EA made its Euro 2012 football game only available as [downloadable content](http://www.t3.com/news/ea-sports-confirms-uefa-euro-2012-game-release-for-april-24th). Last year Apple offered its OS X Lion operating system for sale as a download rather via a physical disc.

So with internet speeds and availability increasing and today's consumer wanting to watch or listen to what they want, when they want to, it is clear that the online revolution will continue apace.  The internet has undoubtedly changed the way we do business and consume media - so much so I wouldn't be surprised that in a few years’ time I will be explaining to my recently born daughter what CDs and DVDs were used for!
