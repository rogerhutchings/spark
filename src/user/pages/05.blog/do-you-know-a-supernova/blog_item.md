[](SuperNova1-150x150.png){.img-left}Remember the SuperNova awards from [Constellation Research](http://www.constellationrg.com/), well they are back again and the closing date for entries is the 22nd of June. I’m a judge again this year and if the quality of last year’s entries is anything to go by then some tough choices will have to be made. It seems that amongst all the economic doom and gloom, many organisations are using technology to drive change and do business in a dramatically different way.

For those of you that don’t know about these awards they are a little different to the norm. Most award programmes recognise technology suppliers for their advancements in the market.  These awards however are focused on the individual who has created change and disruption within their organisation by putting new technologies to work.

There are six categories in all:

  * From Data to Decisions (formerly Big data and analytics)****
  * Consumerization of IT (CoIT) and the new C-Suite
  * Future of work
  * Matrix commerce
  * Next-gen customer experience
  * Technology optimization and innovation

If you know anyone that has done some great work in these areas get them to enter. If you are vendor or services company why not nominate your customers.
