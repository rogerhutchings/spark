We are pleased to announce that we have won a UK PR brief with [Polymatica](https://www.polymatica.com/), a next-generation business intelligence and data science company. The programme includes messaging and positioning work and ongoing thought-leadership and media relations activity - primarily targeting business users in a variety of roles and sectors.

Headquartered in London with offices in Zurich and Moscow, Polymatica was founded by Roman Raevsky and has already built an extensive customer base in Russia, including global retailer Mary Kay and B&N Bank. Polymatica is pioneering new and accessible ways for global businesses to understand and use their data through intuitive analysis software, assisted decision-making solutions and visual storytelling tools as well as consulting services and training. 

Mark Hinds, CEO at Polymatica, had the following to say: “Spark was recommended to us because of the team’s extensive experience in analytics. They were able to understand immediately what we do and find the right stories for us - they’ve already secured us comment opportunities on topical issues such as the recent financial difficulties faced by high street retailers.”
