![classroom-379216_640](classroom-379216_640-150x150.jpg){.img-left}Public Relations is a changeable beast. It encompasses anything and everything from [media relations](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2014/10/22/beware-technology-journalist/) to [event management](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2014/12/15/six-top-tips-organising-managing-international-press-trip/), to content production and [far more in-between](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2014/07/29/nos-seo/). It also spans every industry and imaginable niche. Nowhere is this truer than in tech PR; where conceivably, on a daily basis you can go from talking about big data in drug discovery to business intelligence dashboards in the NHS, to fin tech applications in the cloud.

Being able to juggle, understand and communicate such varied themes is a challenge. Here are some top tech PR traits that all PR pros need – from the very greenest graduate to the most frazzled flack.

  * **Organisation**: Without fail, the ability to organise oneself, manage your time, meet deadlines and handle several clients at once is crucial. They don’t call PR plate spinning for nothin’!
  * **Liking technology**: Incredibly, if you don’t like technology or you can’t tap into [your inner geek](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2014/08/19/ever-perfect-pr-topic-smartphone/), it’s pretty hard to find interesting things to say about it. If you prefer handbags to HPC, tech PR probably isn’t for you (handbag PR definitely _is_).
  * **Put it in a nutshell**: The ability to understand, digest and then communicate complex technical information in a few simple sentences cannot be underrated.
  * **Project confidence**: It’s a [PR-eat-PR](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2014/01/13/press-coverage-competitive-business-tech-pr/) world out there, and you can be sure every other agency in the world is pitching for that national cloud feature. So being able to _confidently_ tell a journalist exactly why they should talk to _your_ client is going to come in handy.
  * **Be literate**: Tech PRs very often find themselves writing about topics that could charitably be called ‘dry’, being able to inject some life and soul into your writing is invaluable.

So, now we’ve covered some of the attributes of successful tech PR pros, what about our clients? It takes two to tango you know, and we’ll take a look from the other side of the aisle next week.
