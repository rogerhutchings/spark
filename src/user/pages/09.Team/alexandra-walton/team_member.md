last_name: Walton
bio: 'With a background in life sciences PR, Alex is using the experience in learning complicated terms to rapidly get to grips with the worlds of security and enterprise IT. For clients, Alex likes to quickly get to the problem a product or service solves and distil this into an interesting story to show how it can benefit the industry in question. As you get to know her, you’ll realise she is an avid Diet Coke drinker, using it to power her through sell ins. Outside of the office she spends her time reading about (and buying too much of) the latest skincare and beauty products – if you have a must try products send the link her way.'
