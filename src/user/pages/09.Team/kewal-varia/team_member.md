bio: 'If you ever need to know the best place to get a good meal or a cocktail, Kewal is your man. A stickler for service, he’s always the mad professor in the room, who will find the random connection that really brings a story to life that others haven’t seen. He’s certainly not a yes man, he’ll tell you exactly what he thinks, and he has an irritating habit of being right. He goes beyond PR to really understand business needs and move beyond the ‘supplier’ relationship with clients. Oh and don’t ask him about his latest scuba diving trip as you’ll likely get your ears bent for a few hours.'
