last_name: Fairless
bio: 'Alice is Spark''s resident songstress, confidently singing along to whichever radio station has triumphed that day in the office radio war. A former languages student, Alice now channels her linguistic passion into writing killer content for her clients and uses her stellar communication skills to leave a smile on the face of any journalist she encounters. In her spare time, you can find Alice hunting for her next read at the local library, sweating it out in a spin class or convincing a dance floor full of people to use her signature dance move - the stag.'
