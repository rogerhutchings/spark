first_name: Andy
last_name: Lloyd-Williams
bio: 'Andy’s talents stretch beyond simple PR: he dabbles in sports journalism, is a published author and lends his support to a multitude of obscure football teams and bands. As he’s learning to speak Italian, trips to cafes and restaurants with Andy can sometimes involve slightly fractured, hand gesture-led conversations with staff as he tests out his skills. Back in his native English, Andy excels at presenting complicated concepts in an easy-to-digest way, from data analysis and customer communications to outsourcing and supply chain management.'
