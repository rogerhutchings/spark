The weather might have cooled down in recent weeks but the competition for the Coverage Cup here at Spark has been as hot as ever. We’ve seen some excellent coverage in the past few weeks with everything from broadcast coverage in Scotland to coverage in the nationals to inclusion in podcasts – and everything in-between.

Starting things off were the IOActive team, who pitched in new research that highlighted issues with satellite systems on aircraft, ships and those by the military that could let hackers take control. The team did a sterling job and secured coverage in _Sky News_, _BBC News_, _The Guardian_ and _Forbes_ amongst others. 

Carrying on with a security theme, the Huntsman team did an excellent job of pitching a media alert on the lack of cybersecurity analysts in Scottish government departments, securing three interviews with _Computer Business Review_, _GovTech Leaders_ and a broadcast piece on the _STV 6 O Clock News_. The news was also covered by the likes of _FutureScot_ and _Infosecurity_. 

The RSA team did a great job of getting coverage in _Risk UK_ for a byline about the future of risk – which apparently is informed by the past. In addition, we had some more security coverage in _Computer Weekly_, _Computer Business Review_ and _Intelligent CISO_ for the launch of Bromium’s Protected App product launch. The Verizon team got some great coverage by news hijacking the Butlin’s data breach and sharing the stats from the company’s DBIR report – resulting in coverage in _Computer Business Review_ and _Infosecurity_. Lastly in terms of security, the Venafi team did a great job of getting comment into an article about a WhatsApp hack in_ The Independent_. 

Moving away from security, Pistoia Alliance had success getting a spokesperson to talk about Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery for a _BenchSci_ podcast. Continuing the life sciences theme, the Elsevier team got coverage in _WIRED_ in a story about the environmental cost of lithium batteries. 

Last but certainly not least, the JDA team had good reason to celebrate after securing a 3-page CEO interview in this month’s _Supply Chain Digital_. 

You can check out the coverage highlights opposite – happy reading!
