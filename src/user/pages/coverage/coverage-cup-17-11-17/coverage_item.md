The nights may be closing in but that hasn’t stopped the team securing some great client coverage over the last couple of weeks.

Customer stories are often like gold dust when it comes to PR, so when we get them we will always look to ensure they get the best possible exposure. With this in mind, it was nice to see the JDA team’s pitching efforts secure coverage in the likes of _Essential Retail_, _Retail Systems_ and _Retail Technology Innovation Hub_ from JDA’s new contract with Clarks. At the same time the HCL team achieved coverage across the IT and FS press from the company’s new engagement with insurance services provider Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group

The Persado team continued to fire on all cylinders over the last couple of weeks, with the marketing press firmly in their sights. The team secured a fantastic opinion piece on _IBT_ looking at the role of artificial intelligence in marketing. At the same time, some clever pitching of the company’s Black Friday research stats resulted in two great pieces on _Media Post_, on top of coverage in _E-Consultancy_ and _Engage Marketing_.

As ever it hasn’t been quiet in the world of IT security, providing ample opportunity for our security clients to get their voice heard. The IOActive team's ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the company in the business and trade media resulted in some fine coverage in both the _FT_ and _The Daily Beast_ over the week. News hijacking and feature coverage continued to be good coverage drivers for RSA, Verizon, Bromium, Venafi and Huntsman; with notable pieces on _Security Week_, _SC Magazine_, _TEISS_, _IT Pro_, _IBS Journal_ and _Retail Gazette_ amongst others.

Some of the fortnight’s Coverage Cup nominations can be found on the list opposite.
