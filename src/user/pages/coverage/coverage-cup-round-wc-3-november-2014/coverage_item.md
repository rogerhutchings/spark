[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Welcome to this weekâ€™s Coverage Cup roundup.

Through crafting a media-worthy story, which highlighted a number of key trends, the team was able to get some great media coverage including BBC News Online and The Independent. Elsewhere, the Trustmarque team achieved coverage on ComputerWorld UK around a cloud computing implementation it had done with Rhead Group. Finally, the Egress team secured some great coverage in the channel press following the launch of the company's new channel programme.
