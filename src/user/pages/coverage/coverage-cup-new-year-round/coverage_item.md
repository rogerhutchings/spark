[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Welcome to the first Coverage Cup round-up post of the New Year. Understandably, a lot of the coverage over the last few weeks has had a festive theme. Firstly, research from the JDA team revealed that nearly a third of online shoppers had trouble with their orders home in the run-up to Christmas – coverage included articles in the _Daily Express, Daily Mail_, _The Independent_ and _Computer Weekly _amongst others. Continuing the Christmas theme, the Centiro team secured an opinion piece on _Retail Gazette_ looking at Christmas delivery experience. Elsewhere, Trustmarque featured in a feature on _TechWeek Europe _asking what IT managers should ask Santa for at Christmas. In non-Christmas related coverage, it was great to see _B2B Marketing_ coverage for our new client, Apppli, who featured in the publication’s B2B marketing predictions 2015 feature. Finally, the Compuware team secured coverage on _V3_ and _Forbes_ for a new product launch. All in all, it was very good Christmas and New Year coverage wise :)
