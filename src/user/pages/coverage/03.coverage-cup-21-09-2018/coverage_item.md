We’ve had a spectacular few weeks in terms of coverage at Spark. In fact, it has been so good that, choosing some of the best coverage has been a real struggle, simply as there has been so much of it!. _The Financial Times_, _Forbes_, _Intelligent CIO_ and _CISO_, _Computer Weekly_,_ Information Age_ and _Gigabit_ to name but a few. 

So rather than choose one, here are three of the best to start us off. First, a fantastic piece of coverage in _Forbes_ about HCL’s work creating a digital platform for Manchester United, where a compelling pitch and top journalist targeting led to a fantastic read in a core business publication. We then had two amazing pieces of coverage in the _Financial Times_. Some skilled pitching lead to the inclusion of Viasat in their Future of Connectivity special report in a story about collaboration in the space industry, highlighting the company’s investment in the sector. The other, a fascinating piece about what makes a good stock picker, in which Inalytics played a prominent rolel, headlining the article and being included throughout. It took a lot of organising, but the team’s hard work definitely paid dividends in the resulting piece of coverage.

Alongside the great pieces of national coverage, we also used our knowledge of vertical publications to help our clients stand out. The launch of JDA’s most recent global Consumer Survey report saw the team using their storytelling skills, alongside stats from the research, to secure coverage in customer experience titles _Engage Customer_ and _Marketing Week_ as well as retail publications _Retail Times_, _Retail Tech Innovation Hub_ and _Retail Systems_ – with 11 pieces of coverage and counting. Not to be outdone, the Ivalua team secured a byline about procurement tech with _Supply Chain Digital_, one of the client’s key target publications. IT security has always been one of Spark’s specialisms and no Coverage Cup post would be without some great security coverage. First off, the Venafi team did a nice job securing coverage for research on both cyberwar and machine identity in _Intelligent CISO_, _Intelligent CIO_ and _TEISS_, among others. Elsewhere, the RSA team worked fast to craft comment, so they could hijack a story about a Nielsen shareholder suing over misleading statements about GDPR readiness, which led to coverage in _Infosecurity Magazine_. Lastly on the security front, the Bromium team secured coverage in _Computer Weekly_ following the appointment of the company’s first Chief Revenue Officer – a great hit for an appointment announcement!

Summer may be over, but the sun isf still shining coverage wise. For some examples, have a look at some of the coverage highlights on the right.
