[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)A busy week at Spark saw some great coverage in a range of top-tier publications. The Bell Integration team achieved fantastic results by piggybacking Gartner’s Hype Cycle Research Report. Andy Soanes, CTO of Bell Integration, was quoted within _Computer Weekly_, _CBR_ and _Cloud Computing Intelligence_ amongst others. The Compuware and HCL teams secured thought-leadership feature coverage in _FSTech_ on the subject of core-banking systems. Meanwhile, Ampersand earned a great piece of coverage within _TechWeek Europe_ on how IoT can save humanity. Ampersand achieved further success with coverage in _PostandParce_l for a case study with Pelipod, the developer of a smart parcel delivery box.

The full list of Coverage Cup nominations for the week can be found below:
