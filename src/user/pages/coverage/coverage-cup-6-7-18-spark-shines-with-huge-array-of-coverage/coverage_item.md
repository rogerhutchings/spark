        - 'Coverage Cup'
---

It has been another exceptional fortnight for Spark client coverage across a broad range of publications. Coverage was achieved from proactive feature pitching to national journalists, news hijacking and headline-driven research.

The landmark pieces of the fortnight have been supplied by the MuleSoft team, who were busy pitching the key findings from the company’s Consumer Connectivity Insights report. The team has been involved with the research from the very start; from creating the storyline and questions through to writing the report and press releases. So, it was great to see the fruits of this labour result in an impressive array of coverage. The standout pieces included coverage on _The Independent_, _Bloomberg_ and _Computer Weekly_.

The national coverage didn’t stop there, with the Ivalua getting into an article on sustainability in construction in _The Times/Raconteur’s_ Future of Procurement supplement. News hijacking was also a coverage driver for the Ivalua team, who managed to get some comments included on _Supply Management_, _Compelo_ and _Catering News_ stories on the CO2 shortage and how it may affect beer and soft drinks for the World Cup.

The RSA team successfully hijacked the news that Islington Council had demanded residents send their credit card details via unsecure email! Some quick thinking from the team, and comment imploring consumers to think twice before sharing sensitive data, resulted in coverage on _New Statesman Tech_, _Teiss_, _The Inquirer_ and _V3_.

Meanwhile the Quadient and Liferay teams secured news hijack coverage in _Financial IT’s_ story on Gartner’s customer experience study. 

Finally, the Bromium team had a great byline article published on _ITProPortal_ looking at what enterprises should consider when buying security tools.

The full list of Coverage Cup nominations for the last fortnight can be found opposite.
