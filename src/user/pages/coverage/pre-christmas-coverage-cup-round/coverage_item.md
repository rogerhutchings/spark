[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Welcome to this week’s bumper pre-Christmas Coverage Cup roundup! Over the course of December, we’ve helped our clients get some great coverage in a range of IT, vertical and national media. The Tier-3 Huntsman team news hijacked the Sony Pictures computer hacks, resulting in coverage in _The Register_ and _Computer Weekly_. Remaining on the security theme, Egress revealed the findings of a Freedom of Information request to the Information Commissioner's Office which showed that one-quarter of reported data breaches were caused by the accidental loss or destruction of personal data during the first three months of 2014\. Due to some successful pitching of the findings the team achieved coverage in the likes of _CBR_ and _The Register_.

Elsewhere, research carried out from JDA looked at the online delivery woes facing European shoppers, which resulted in coverage on _Retail Systems, Essential Retail_ and _Business Reporter. _Also is the retail space, Trace One ran a media alert around the upcoming Food Information Regulation and achieved coverage on _The Grocer, Food Manufacture_ and _Retail Times_.

Finally, the TAG Assessment team were really pleased to achieve coverage on the _Daily Telegraph_ for an opinion piece looking at the state of the exam grading system. Below is the list of all the Coverage Cup nominations over the last few weeks:
