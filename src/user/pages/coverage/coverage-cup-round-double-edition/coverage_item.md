[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)This week it is a double Coverage Cup round up - we got distracted by the excitement of the World Cup, hence the delay! Top picks included coverage achieved by the Elsevier team in the oil and energy press, while the JDA team secured opinion piece coverage in _The Guardian. _Elsewhere in the office, we secured comment in _CBR_’s ‘15 ways to explain the Internet of Things (IoT) to a five-year-old’ feature for a couple of different clients. A selection of the coverage nominations are below - which do you think deserved to win?
