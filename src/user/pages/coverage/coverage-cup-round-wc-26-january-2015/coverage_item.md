[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)While the weather outside remains pretty cold, things are starting to warm up on the coverage front. The latest version of next-generation security software Carbon Black 5.0 launched with the Bit9 team scoring pieces in _ComputerWorldUK _and _V3_ about how it could be a game-changer. The Egress team news hijacked Global Data Protection Day with its FoI stats about 93% of data breaches being down to human error. The result was some great coverage in the IT and security press. Finally, the iPass team successfully placed a CEO opinion piece with _Telecoms.com_ asking if Google or Facebook will be your future Wi-Fi provider.
