It has been a busy few weeks here at Spark towers with some notable client coverage spanning business, IT and vertical media.

First up were the Bromium team who released the initial findings of a joint study it has done with Surrey University looking at cryptocurrency and cybercrime.  Some great storytelling and media pitching led to coverage in the likes of_ The Register_, _Computer Weekly_ and _News Statesman Tech _ amongst others. The cherry on top however was a fantastic piece on _BBC News Online_.

Not to be outdone in the _BBC_ coverage stakes, the Venafi team demonstrated some top-notch news-hijacking prowess after successfully pitching some comment regarding how Oculus VR headsets went offline due to certificate error. Elsewhere in the world of security the RSA team had a couple of fantastic business press hits; firstly, in the _FT_ for a feature looking at the security vulnerabilities surrounding SMS messaging, and secondly in a _Telegraph_ feature about human behaviour and digital security.

Business press coverage hasn’t just been restricted to Spark’s security clients over the last few weeks. The Centiro team scored coverage in _The Times’_ ‘Future of Retail’ supplement with some comment looking at the need for greater retailer collaboration when it comes to deliveries. The JDA and Couchbase teams also joined the party with _The Times_ ‘Future of Retail’ and ‘Business Transformation’ supplements respectively, using some of the companies’ latest research findings.

Events and interviews have also been a big coverage driver in recent weeks. We secured several journalists to attend Ivalua’s London event last week and already _Supply Management_ has written up x3 separate stories from the event with more coverage to follow. Elsewhere, the Verizon team got some stellar coverage in the likes of _Light Reading_ and _Capacity_ following the company’s recent event with Colt. The JDA team meanwhile secured interviews with JDA Software’s CEO, Girish Rishi, to discuss how tech trends such as AI and machine learning will impact supply chains the future. Some of the fruits of this labour can be seen on _diginomica_ and _Internet of Business_.

Last but by no means least, there has been some grade A news-hijacking across a number of accounts. The Huntsman team scored coverage with _Computer Weekly_ and _CBR_ after jumping on the latest Russian cyber-attack allegation. Meanwhile, the Centiro team were at it again, this time successfully pitching in comment for x2 different news-hijacks in the last fortnight which resulted in coverage on likes of _Internet Retailing_, _Retail Tech Innovation Hub_ and_ Internet of Business_.
Opposite is an extended list of coverage highlights.
