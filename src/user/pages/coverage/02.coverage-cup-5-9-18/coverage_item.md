In August, the industry tends to quieten down as people escape for more reliable weather and relaxation – but not here at Spark! Over the last two weeks we have been splitting our time between client sell-ins, news hijacks and securing interviews with our client’s target press. This has resulted in excellent coverage in the likes of _Forbes_, _TEISS_, _Scientific Computing World_ and _The Register_.

The COMPAREX team reaped the rewards of a Freedom of Information (FoI) request. Working closely with the client to craft the story, the FoI looked at whether English councils are using out of date server software and the security risks this could lead to.  The combination of headline grabbing statistics and great media pitching resulted in some fantastic media coverage in the likes of _Computer Weekly_, _The Register_ and _The Inquirer_ just to name a few. 

Elsewhere, RSA Security announced the results of its latest global fraud report for Q2 2018. The report found that fraud continues to rise, especially from mobile browsers and mobile applications which represented 71 per cent of total fraudulent transactions recorded. Spark helped RSA to a develop a topical storyline which not only represented the findings of the report, but complemented RSA’s internal messaging. The team was able to secure coverage in the likes of _The Register_, _IT Pro_, _Specialist Banking_ and _Computer Weekly_ – which also interviewed the director of RSA’s fraud and risk intelligence unit about the findings and why the results are important for the industry. 

The last fortnight saw the Dynatrace team selling in its highly-anticipated consumer IoT research project. The survey of 10,000 global consumers revealed that almost two thirds of worldwide users of Internet of Things devices have encountered performance issues. These figures grabbed the attention of the likes of _Government Europa_, _IoT News_ and _Information Age_. 

Meanwhile, The Pistoia Alliance announced updates to its Chemical Safety Library Service (CSL). As the project looks to expand its horizons and continue its great work for lab safety, Spark helped to raise awareness and secured coverage in some of the industry’s most respected publications, including _PharmaVOICE_, _Bio-IT World_ and _Chemicals-technology_. The team also secured a great piece of coverage in _Scientific Computing World_, following an interview with The Alliance and researchers from the University of Southampton. Spark’s relationship with the journalist resulted in our client and the researchers taking over the entire feature, discussing why the data in the CSL is valuable to the industry. 

Finally, we were quickly across the news of the new banking rules set by the FCA to increase banking transparency. Quadient and Dynatrace teams’ combined efforts to hijack the news with comment discussing the performance and customer experience impact on the industry. Our efforts were rewarded with coverage in _FS Tech_, _The Register_, _Specialist Banking_, _Global Treasurer_ and _Financial IT_ amongst others. 

Some of the coverage highlights can be seen to the right!
