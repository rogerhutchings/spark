In a fortnight that saw Angelique Kerber storm to her first Wimbledon title, Novak Djokovic lift the trophy for a fourth time, the Spark team was also on great form. Over the past two weeks there has been some truly outstanding coverage, more than worthy of lifting a big golden trophy with a [pineapple](https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/989089/Wimbledon-trophy-why-is-there-a-pineapple) on top of it.

The standout piece of the last fortnight has to be a fantastic piece of _Financial Times_ coverage which came off the back of the Bromium team’s [Web of Profit](https://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/blog/into-the-web-of-rsa-conference) research earlier in the year. The team came up with an idea for a feature highlighting key areas of the report, and proactively pitched this, securing three briefings including one with the RSA team, resulting in a truly ace story with both clients included!

The Elsevier team also had success with the _Financial Times_ with a letter to the editor around attracting talent into the life sciences industry. Elsewhere, the Dynatrace team successfully hijacked some bad news for Facebook. Not only did the social media giants’ main app go down for Android users, but so did Facebook Messenger, resulting in a fantastic writeup in _METRO_. News hijacking also resulted in the Venafi team securing a lovely piece in _Computer Weekly_ on ActionFraud’s warning that hackers are scamming people by mimicking university email domains.

The Viasat team was also busy with a partnership story with Finnair, whose customers can now take advantage of satellite-provided internet services, enabling them to surf the web, shop online, listen to music and even stream films in-flight. The result was a number of great articles with the likes of _Get Connected_, _Telecom Paper_ and _Light Reading_. 

Elsewhere, Liferay achieved coverage with a great feature on what makes a great bespoke business app on _Cloud Pro_. The JDA team also had success with an opinion piece on key trends in the supply chain appeared on _CBR_.

In a fortnight of champions, we had some winning coverage. Hopefully our great form continues.
