The UK may have said hello to Prince Louis, and Arsenal may have said goodbye to Arsene Wenger, but here at Spark we’ve seen the national press concentrate on much, much, much more interesting stories. 

April saw two big security research projects come to fruition. Verizon’s annual Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) provided new insights into the patterns behind breaches in the past year – and was shared by, among others, the _New Statesman_ and _BBC_. 

Throughout the month, Spark also made sure that we were responding to big, breaking news stories on behalf of our clients. From Russia targeting UK infrastructure, which saw RSA featured in the _New Statesman_: to IOActive commenting on killer robots in the _Independent_; to a security breach with Great Western Railway making the _BBC_, _Sky News_ and the _Press Association_ (and beyond): to the _BBC_ also reporting on the UK government’s survey on how businesses are coping with cyber-attacks, including comment by Huntsman. No approach was out of bounds – a simple letter to the editor saw Pistoia Alliance’s views on Artificial Intelligence covered by the _Guardian_, while a long-running discussion saw RSA commenting on data privacy for_ BBC Technology of Business. _

It wasn’t all security and AI, though. Viasat also had an announcement to make – opening its new Dublin office. A new technology hub in the capital, coupled with the announcement of new high-tech jobs for the nation, gave Spark an excellent story to take to the Irish press, and they responded in kind – with enthusiastic coverage in the _Irish Times_, _Irish Sun_ and _RTÉ_. 

So if you’re looking to read something that’s not about Wenger Out, or bouncing baby royals, take a look to the right
