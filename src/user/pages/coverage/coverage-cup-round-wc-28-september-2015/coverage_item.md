[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)There was some great national coverage achieved last week. Trace One was featured in _The Times'_ Future of Packaging supplement looking at the digital future of food packaging. Meanwhile, ViaSat and Virgin Americaâ€™s in-flight connectivity announcement was covered in both the _Daily Mail_ and _The Economist_. Elsewhere, our newest client Venafi secured top coverage on _Business Reporter_, following recent research on the security of online security keys and certificates.

We also helped secure a number of opinion pieces last week, including a couple for Elsevier in _BioscienceTechnology_ and _Chemistry Views_. In addition, Brett Hofer, Global DevOps Practice Lead at Dynatrace was published on _CBR_ with his expert opinion on DevOps methodology. Last but by no means least, Huntsman Security were successfully featured in _Computer Weekly _after an interview in which CEO, Peter Woollacott explained how the security industry must help business prioritise cyber risk.
