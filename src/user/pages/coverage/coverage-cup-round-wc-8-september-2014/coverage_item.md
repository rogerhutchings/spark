[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Welcome to this weekâ€™s Coverage Cup round up! Smartphone security was at the top of the agenda this week with SRD Wireless commenting on the potential security risks of iOS 8 and the ICO's report into how mobile applications are using data. Meanwhile the Elsevier team successfully placed an opinion piece on the science behind geoscience decisions with _Hart E&P._ In addition, it was great to see Changepoint included in a _Times _feature on the subject of project management._ _
