This is the first Coverage Cup update for our sparkling new website and what a great fortnight it has been. We have had some incredible results from client news this week, specifically securing pieces on _Bloomberg_, _TEISS_, _Retail Gazette_, _The Register_ and _Computer Weekly_ to name a few. As ever the ability to tell clients’ news in a way that is interesting and tells a story is what allows us to achieve such great results. This same storytelling approach helped us secure coverage for two clients in a _Times_ sales supplement. 

We have helped clients in delivering thought leadership in the form of contributed articles for _CIO Applications Magazine_, _PharmaTimes_ and _IT Pro Portal_. We have also had a lot of success over the past fortnight securing business and vertical coverage for clients in the military, retail and pharma media. The team were also particularly proud of reaching a US audience through coverage in _Business Review USA_ and _Campaign US_.

The industry news this fortnight has been a gift, we were able to hijack a few stories for clients getting coverage on _Computer Business Review_ and _Financial IT_. Finally, we successfully engaged with a feature writer to have two clients appear in _Scientific Computing World_.
