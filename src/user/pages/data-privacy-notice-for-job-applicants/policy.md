##	How do we collect your personal data?

We will collect this information from a range of sources, which will include your application form, CV, your passport or other identity documents, or information provided directly by you through interviews.

The organisation will also collect personal data about you from third parties, such as references supplied by former employers and employment agencies. The organisation will seek information from former employers only once a job offer to you has been made and will inform you that it is doing so.

## Unsolicited CVs

If we receive an unsolicited CV at a time when we are not recruiting, we will either delete the CV or keep it on file for future recruitment rounds, if you do not wish us to retain your CV then please email us.

##	How will we use your personal data?

Throughout the recruitment process we will need to process your personal data for one or more of the following lawful bases: 

-	Where we need to process your personal data to take specific steps at your request before entering into a contract with you or we need to process data to enter into a contract with you. This may include making reasonable adjustments to the recruitment process to accommodate disabilities as and when requested. 
-	Where we need to process your personal data to comply with a legal obligation, for example if your application is successful we will check your right to work in the UK before a job offer is made. 
-	Our legitimate reason for processing your personal data is to enable us to gather data so that we can assess which candidate’s skills and experience is the best match with our job role requirements and therefore suitable for employment.

-	Where it is needed in the public interest.

During the application and recruitment process and for a short period after the recruitment process, we will use your personal information for specific purposes. The list below describes the purpose of our processing, the personal data involved (from clause 3 above) and the lawful basis for our processing (from clause 5 above):
