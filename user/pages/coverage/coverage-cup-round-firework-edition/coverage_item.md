![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Spark’s bonfire night went off with a bang with some awe-inspiring coverage. Elsevier had the biggest spectacle of all; discussing the challenges of developing sustainable packaging in _The Times_. And the gems just kept coming for Elsevier, with further coverage in _Scientific Computing_ and _Information Age_. Not to be outdone, Compuware also managed to get its views across in _Information_ _Age_, with an opinion piece with tips on engaging millennials to work on mainframes.

Trustmarque reacted to a _Computing _poll and were featured on _V3,_ discussing cloud migration. And last, but by no means least, Venafi had their fingers on the pulse to quickly respond to the news that Google was attempting to boost security with new guidelines for certificates, which resulted in a great piece on _Infosecurity_. All in all, an explosive week for Spark. A full list of coverage cup nominations can be found below:
