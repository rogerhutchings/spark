[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)March 2nd marked the anniversary of Dr. Seussâ€™ birthday and so it seemed only appropriate that it was a week when the Spark team got coverage here, there and everywhere! The iPass team kicked off proceedings with a great piece in the _Wall Street Journal_ looking at how easy it is to go Wi-Fi only, which referenced data from iPass' global Wi-Fi map. Meanwhile the Bit9 team, placing a great byline in _Computer Business Review_ from UK MD David Flower on how enterprises can handle the security challenges of the Windows Server 2003 reaching end of life. Finally, the Trustmarque team successfully hijacked a REC/KPMG report about IT job growth highlighting how companies must embrace flexible resourcing in today's market.

Below are the rest of the Coverage Cup nominations from last week.
