[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Here at Spark we have had a busy couple of weeks and have achieved some fantastic results for a range of our clients. The HCL team has gone and won the Coverage Cup with several top-tier hits in titles such as _IDG Connect_, _TechWorld_ and _Econsultancy_, following HCL and Manchester United’s digital partnership announcement earlier last week. It was a close call for second place as the Verizon, Trustmarque and ViaSat teams secured coverage in a couple of _Times_ supplements.

Over the last couple of weeks, we have achieved some great by-line placements. Verizon’s Laurance Dine’s financial security by-line was successfully featured in _Financial IT_. Next up was Fruition’s Paul Cash, who received by-line coverage in _CBR _for his article on End User IT Analytics. Lastly, but by no means least, an article By Digital Assess’, Dan Sandhu was placed with _the Training Journal._

Elsewhere, Guavus’ new product announcement was featured in _Vanilla Plus_. Egress received coverage in the _International Business Times_ following the data breach at a London health clinic, which quoted the company's CEO, Tony Pepper. Finally, The Elsevier team scored top-tier news publication in _Fierce Biotech IT_ following their partnership announcement with University College London.
