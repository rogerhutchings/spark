![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)While Toblerone and Maltesers are cutting down the size of their offerings, Spark was bucking the trend by continuing to serve up some huge client coverage.

JDA got the first slice of the pie, commenting on the latest supply chain trends in _The Times_. Elsewhere, iPass got a large helping of coverage with the results of its Mobile Professional Report featuring on the _Daily Mail_ and _International Business Times _amongst others. Other survey-related coverage saw Changepoint make the news on _The C-Suite_, while and Venafi’s stats showing a third of websites could stop working in January made the headlines in the _New Statesman._

Opinions were the flavour of the week, with 3CX discussing how to grow a business internationally in_ Fresh Business Thinking_. Bromium rounded up the byline coverage this week by discussing ransomware on _Information Age_.

Filling up the dessert cart, an interview with Compuware’s CEO got a satisfying write up in _The Stack_. Coverage in _The Irish Times_ put the icing on the cake for ViaSat following its acquisition of Arconics. The final pieces of the pie were for Dynatrace and Verizon, who commented on retail sales figures for _Retail Gazette_ and IMRG’s Black Friday predictions for _CBR_ respectively.

A sweet week for Spark. A full list of coverage cup nominations can be found below:
