It’s been a fantastic couple weeks of client coverage here at Spark. For Bromium we had a partnership with the Met Police cybercrime unit to announce. Rather than just pushing a press release, we built a story around the challenges of cyber policing in a world where the criminals always seem to be a step ahead. That storytelling approach got us interviews with business and trade press, and bags of coverage, with a standout pieces in _New Statesman Tech_ and _Sky News_ (which even includes a product demo video). 

Building a compelling pitch based on current trends around AI within the science community resulted in interview coverage for Elsevier in _Research Information_. The MuleSoft’s teams’ work in securing interviews with MuleSoft CEO, Greg Schott, saw two fantastic write ups on _ComputerworldUK_ and _ZDNet_ highlighting the company’s growing focus on data analytics and security. Elsewhere the HCL team set to the seas with noteworthy coverage on _Computer Weekly_ after setting up media interviews around the company’s involvement supporting the IT for the Volvo Ocean Race.

The Persado team had some great hits in the last couple of weeks.  The team secured an opportunity for _DataIQ_ to speak with the company’s co-founder Assaf Baciu to discuss its newly launched Marketing Language Cloud. Some great pitching also saw the news being covered in a piece on _NetImperative_. 

The Spark team has also secured a range of client thought leadership coverage over the last two weeks. Servion’s CEO had a great piece on _Raconteur_ regarding the ‘emotion economy’ and the technological impact on this new kind of currency. Elsewhere, Centiro got ahead of the game, with a comment piece in _Internet Retailing_ discussing Christmas delivery to nudge retailers into preparing for the busy time ahead.

Finally, the news of vulnerabilities in a discontinued satellite platform provided IOActive with a news hijacking opp. IOActive had asked us to push for vertical maritime coverage to build on the regular national and trade media we secure. Quick to spot the news and comment, the IOActive team secured sector specific news hijacking coverage on _Lloyds List/Maritime Intelligence_ and _Ship Management International_ amongst others.
