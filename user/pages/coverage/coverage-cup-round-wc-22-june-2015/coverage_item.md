[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-150x150.jpg)The sunshine is clearly lifting the mood as the Spark team continues a great run of coverage for clients. First up, Dynatrace features heavily in a supplement for _The Times _about the future of omni-channel retail, speaking about the way in which businesses can maintain crucial consistency in the online retail space. In second place, some excellent advice form Trustmarque CTO James Butler about how enterprises can handle the challenges of shadow IT in _The Register_. And finally, rounding out the week, an important news hijack about the dangers of infant milk formula from Trace One saw coverage appear in _Just-Food._
