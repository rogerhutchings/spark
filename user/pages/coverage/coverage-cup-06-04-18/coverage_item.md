The Easter period might have left some of us feeling very full after too much chocolate, but it hasnâ€™t stopped the Spark team getting some high-quality coverage. 

iPass released its annual Mobile Security Report looking at CIOs and their views on mobile security. Great storytelling and media contacts resulted in coverage in _New Statesman_, _Computer Weekly_ and _IT Pro Portal_ amongst others. 

Not to be outdone the Viasat team got some great business press coverage for an ongoing dispute with a core competitor in both the print and online versions of the _Telegraph_. News hijacking continued to deliver great business, tech and vertical coverage for clients with pieces on _Sky_, _CBR_, and _Retail Logistics International_. Both the Comparex and 3CX teams got thought leadership pieces in key small business titles _Small Business_ and _Real Business_ reaching core audiences for them. 

Last but by no means least, the Pistoia Alliance team focused on the latest trends and used great storytelling skills at its annual conference to get over ten pieces of coverage. Look opposite for some of the highlights of this and other stories this week.
