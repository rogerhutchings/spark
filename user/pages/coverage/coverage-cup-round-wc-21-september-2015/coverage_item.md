[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Advantage Spark. With the rugby in full swing, the Dynatrace team secured coverage in _CBR _by monitoring the IRB app and website. Bit9 jumped on _Gartner_’s security spending report, which resulted in a great _InfoSecurity Magazine_ article. The Elsevier team arranged an interview with _Chemical & Engineering News_, which evolved into an article reinforcing Elsevier’s position as a thought leader. Finally, the Verizon team put points on the board after converting a mobile malware feature opportunity in _Information Age _and placing a blog post with_ The Digital Banking Club_.
