Last weekend saw the hottest early May Bank Holiday on record, with temperatures soaring to a sizzling 29C in places. While the seasonal grey clouds will no-doubt start to kick back in by the back end of the week, the Spark team will still be Walking on Sunshine after the success of the last couple of weeks.

April ended with a bang for the Bromium and Huntsman teams, with a successful joint news hijack on international law enforcement agencies taking down the Webstresser cybercrime platform, resulting in coverage with _SC Media UK_ and _Financial IT_, as well as a great piece with _BBC News Online_.

Raconteur’s supplement on Fintech (published in _The Times_) was also fruitful for Spark, with MuleSoft being quoted in an open banking feature after successfully pitching a spokesperson interview. 

The Centiro team meanwhile secured some fantastic coverage in _The Telegraph_ as part of a feature looking at ultra low-emission zones. With the client looking to elevate industry discussion around sustainable deliveries this article certainly ticked all the boxes.   

Finally, we saw some great Couchbase coverage with _Computer Weekly_ about its good work with Belgian health consulting firm, AEDES, that is helping health records in the Democratic Republic of Congo to remain online in challenging conditions.

Overall, Spark’s coverage is more predictable than the weather – come rain or shine we always deliver.
