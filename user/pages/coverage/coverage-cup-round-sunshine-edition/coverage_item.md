![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)While making the most of Britain’s long-awaited summer, Spark has been busy achieving some great media coverage on behalf of our clients. First off, Elsevier’s thoughts on how digital technology can help engineers to be more collaborative appeared in _The Engineer_. The 3CX team secured coverage in _Channelnomics_ after CEO Nick Galea was interviewed regarding the company's plans for European expansion. Elsewhere, _Global Banking & Finance Review_ published a profile on GMC Software which outlined its capabilities and how companies can achieve excellent customer experience in three steps. Finally, the Trustmarque team hit the phones and secured news hijacking coverage in _V3_, Business Cloud News and Cloud Tech after Gartner predicted that cloud spending could reach $1tn by 2020 - the resulting coverage firmly positioned Trustmarque as a thought leader on the subject.

As you can see, a busy week was had by all! Now, where’s my sun cream?
