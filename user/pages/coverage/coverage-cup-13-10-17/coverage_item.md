        - 'Coverage Cup'
---

It was another well fought Coverage Cup contest based on client coverage from the last couple of weeks. The Servion team bid for the win with some brilliant video coverage on _Compare the Cloud_ discussing blockchain, but they were quickly challenged by the Couchbase team who secured some great coverage off the back of the company’s recent European conference.

There was a Skype face-off between our remote workers as David from the Venafi team argued that broadcast interviews on _Sky News_ and _CNN International_ were both worthy winners of the cup. Whereas Tris from the Compuware team disputed this, presenting product coverage in _The Register_ as more impressive. Elsewhere, the Persado team piped up with national coverage on _The Telegraph_, the first piece for our new client – and a smashing start to the account. 

Finally, after opening up the tequila brought back from a recent staff holiday, the whole company conceded that although close, it was a case of both quality and quantity. As Lauren was working in the office we left the final Coverage Cup decision in her hands. But we’ll leave you to guess who was eventually presented with the cup.
