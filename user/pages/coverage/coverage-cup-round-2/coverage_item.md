[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)As we collectively get over the January blues, there has been plenty of client press coverage to raise the spirits. Firstly, the JDA team continued to get mileage from its Christmas shopping survey, with some great coverage in _Draper_s.  Christmas also featured for the Guavus team in a _Land Mobile_ article about Santa using GPS. Next up the iPass team successfully pitched a story to _Computer Weekly_ about how SAS was using the iPass global Wi-Fi network to support all its flight crews. The Dynatrace team were active as well getting some excellent coverage in _Computing_, that looked at the new-look Compuware. Finally, the Egress team secured a great pieced in _IT Security Guru _about the potential for identity theft when dealing with mortgage applications. 

Below is a list of all the coverage highlights over the last couple of weeks:
