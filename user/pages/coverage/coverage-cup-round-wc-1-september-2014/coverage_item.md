[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Last week saw coverage across a wide range of different media, from IT to retail to travel. The ElasticHosts team launched a research study last week, which looks at CIOs attitudes towards the service they receive from cloud providers, this resulted in top-tier coverage in the likes of _ZDNet_, _Computing_ and _ComputerworldUK_.Â Elsewhere, the Compuware team placed an opinion piece with _Information Age_ on the influence DevOps will have on the future of IT, while the iPass team secured an opinion article on _Travolution_ on the importance of connectivity services for the modern business traveller. Below is a selection of the best coverage from the last 7 days:
