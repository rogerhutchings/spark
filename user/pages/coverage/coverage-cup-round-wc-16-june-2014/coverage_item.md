[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Last week one of our clients, ElasticHosts, highlighted how much wasted cloud capacity is costing business each year.  The resulting media alert and sell in garnered some great pick up in the IT press.  In the meantime, the JDA team got a great piece of coverage in The Independent off the back of some retail CEO research.  A round up of the above activity and the other nominations is below - who do you think deserved to wear the CC crown this week?
