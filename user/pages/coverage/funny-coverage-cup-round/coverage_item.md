![](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)The first Sunday of May marks World Laughter Day, but our clients have been grinning for a completely different reason this week, thanks to media coverage.

HCL was left beaming after featuring in _The Sunday Times’_ Future of Financial Services supplement, commenting on the acceptance of blockchain within the financial industry. MuleSoft also had reason to smile this week, joining the fun by securing coverage the same supplement with its comments on the role of APIs in banking’s ‘brave new world’.

And the antics didn’t stop there. Verizon released its 10th annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) and the stats made the report generated big news. _Share Radio_ discussed the report live on its morning show, while there was further great coverage on _Bloomberg _and in _The Times _amongst others.

3CX highlighted how the channel can keep smiling beyond ISDN with comments featured on _Channel Biz_ and _Computer Weekly_. Venafi also chuckled with joy this week, after its opinion piece on cybersecurity in the financial industry featured on _FX-MM_. Last but not least, the Pistoia Alliance’s opinion piece on real world data and its importance in the life science industry appeared in this month’s edition of _Pharmafocus_.
