![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)With Easter truly behind us and the chocolate long gone, at Spark we’ve thrown ourselves back into achieving some great client coverage.

First to shrug off the chocolate-hangover this week was IOActive, who released a warning regarding the security of some household wireless routers, which was featured in _The Independent _amongst others_._ Venafi also made it into the national news, with comments on how secure HTTPS encryption and the ‘green padlock’ being covered by _International Business Times_. And that wasn’t all for Venafi this week, with the company's CEO being interviewed by _ComputerWorldUK_.

The Huntsman team were also on the ball this week, responding to news of a manhunt for the mole who passed secrets to Wikileaks, and getting its comments featured in coverage of the story on _V3._ ViaSat was also quick off the mark to comment on the news the Intercontinentalial Hotels Group had been hit by a card payment hack, securing coverage in leading travel publication _Travolution_.

Never ones to lag after a break, the Couchbase team were in full flow, placing a byline article on user experience with _MyCustomer.com_. Last but not least, it was a double hit for Spark clients this week with both JDA and Retail Pro International both featuring in a whitepaper about retail in America from _Retail Week_.

A full list of coverage can be found below.
