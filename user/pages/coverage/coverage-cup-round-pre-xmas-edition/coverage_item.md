![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)The holidays may just be around the corner, and Christmas songs blasting out on the office radio, but that hasn’t stopped us from counting up all the coverage in this bumper update.

ViaSat was rocking around the Christmas tree with its coverage - _New Statesman Tech _quoted the company in an article on the UK’s renewed broadband commitment, while the company’s superfast broadband research appeared on _The Register__._ In addition, like a child at Christmas, the ViaSat team were up before the dawn to respond to the recent Deutsche Telecom’s hack and react to the BT and Openreach split.

As an early stocking filler, Venafi were quoted in not one, but two features in _The Times’_ cybersecurity supplement, discussing how to limit the damage after a data breach. Roc also had reason to start its celebrations early, with its comments on consulting collaboration achieving coverage in the _Financial Times._

JDA have already had a stocking-full of treats this December with its research on supply chain segmentation making the news in _The Manufacturer _and _Logistics Manager _amongst others_._

Finally, the Couchbase team were in their own (winter) wonderland with the company's views on the Internet of Things making it onto the _Internet of Business, _as well as its comments on Amazon’s new bricks and mortar store featuring in an _Internet Retailing_ article_. _Couchbase also made it onto _Marketing Tech News_ with an opinion piece on how to use big data effectively as a marketing tool.

The full list of coverage cup nominations can be found below:
