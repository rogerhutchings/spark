Who can believe we are already midway through February? Well, it feels like we are over the worst of winter; the days are getting longer and the daffodils, while not out in full, are starting to make an appearance. It’s the perfect time for holding events. The amount of blood, sweat and tears that goes into events from both client and agency side can seem overwhelming. So it’s great to see the results of these efforts come through, and of course it also makes them worthy Coverage Cup nominations. 

The RSA team held a risk panel discussion event with journalists from all over the world, preparation for which was six months in the making; developing the themes and agenda, organising panellists and journalists, and carrying out research in time for the big day. Worthy nominations from the team included _Marketing Week_, _Computer Weekly_, and _Digiday_. The real coverage battle though, occurred between a piece in _Sky_ and _Drapers_, with the office very divided on which was the most worthy – given the influential _Drapers_ is notoriously difficult to get into without being a fashion brand. 

Another client event occurring in the last couple of weeks was Dynatrace’s global conference, Perform. Having driven the messaging and storyline for media, it was great to see multiple pieces from attending journalists at _CBR_ and _diginomica_. _CBR_ was also live tweeting from the event, driving eyeballs to the innovations Dynatrace was announcing. The survey we launched at the event also drove over 50 pieces of global media coverage. 

Carefully crafted research stories were also launched by the Bromium team – seeing results in publications like _Computing_ and _SC Magazine_. And the Pistoia Alliance team pulled it out of the bag by securing _Forbes_ coverage for a survey of life scientists’ views on AI. 

With journalists being typically ‘time poor’, pitching for interviews can be very tough – it’s all about coming up with an angle that you can see as an article. Focusing on the angle secured interview coverage for Mulesoft’s CEO in _Data Economy_, and Venafi’s director of threat intelligence in _CBR_.
