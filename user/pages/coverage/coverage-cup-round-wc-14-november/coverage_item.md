![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Winter is coming. But here at Spark, we aren’t letting the short days get in the way of a dazzling amount of client coverage. IOActive illuminated our day with coverage on _Reuters_ about cyber attacks and the Internet of Things, which then got picked up by a number of other publications too. That wasn’t all for IOActive, whose comment on the Tesco Bank hack got a mention in _The Economist_. Huntsman was also quick to spot a fresh opportunity with the Tesco Bank hack, which resulted in some fantastic coverage on the _BBC_, as well as _IT PRO_.

Elsevier also came out beaming, as it featured in a _Financial Times_ article on microbiomes, and they weren’t the only ones as Pistoia also had its say on the need to collaborate to drive innovation.

Dynatrace finished the week on a high, with research on China Singles Day making a splash in the _International Business Times_ as well as _Retail Times_ and _Computer Business Review_. Last, but by no means least, HCL’s opinion piece about the use of digital technologies found its way onto _Digitalisation World. _
