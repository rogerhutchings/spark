[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)The week started off with the announcement that Britain will retaliate in kind to cyber-attacks. Jumping on the news the Venafi team secured expert comment on both _The Daily Telegraph_ and _Sky News.__ _Elsewhere, the Green Grid urged datacentre operators to consider the environmental impact of their activity, a sentiment echoed by Romonetâ€™s CEO Zahl Limbuwala in comment successfully pitched to _Computer Weekly_. Finally, there was a double hit for iPass with its Business Traveler Cost Index being widely referenced in a Computer Weekly piece on mobile roaming charges, and CBR featuring an interview with the company's CCO, Patricia Hulme, on why workforces need seamless W-Fi connectivity.
