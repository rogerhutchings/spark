![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Is the bank holiday referred to as a ‘national holiday’ because of the amount of national coverage Spark secures around that weekend? If not, it should be :). Egress paved the way by keeping their fingers on the pulse to quickly respond to an email leak by prison officers in Northern Ireland – achieving coverage on _The Telegraph’_s website. Egress also secured coverage on _New Statesman Tech_ for research which found humans are still to blame for data breaches. Not to be out done, HCL secured coverage in a feature on monetising data within _The Times’ Raconteur_ supplement. To round up an impressive collection of national coverage, Venafi placed an opinion article with _New Statesman Tech_ on the snoopers charter. Spark also scored some good hits within the IT and vertical press. VMTurbo placed on article on using software to control cloud resources with _CBR_, while Trace One commented on Lidl recalling product lines in _FoodBev_. A full list of coverage cup nominations can be found below:
