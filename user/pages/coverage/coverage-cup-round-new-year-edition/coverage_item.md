Starting 2017 on the right foot, Spark has continued to drive some great coverage across national and top-tier enterprise technology press.

Kicking things off, the IOActive team secured coverage in _The Telegraph_, after researchers found a security hole in the Panasonic in-flight system, which could enable hackers to take control of an airplane mid-flight. Also in The Telegraph, there was success for the Couchbase team who had their technology prediction featured in a round up for SMEs.

There were technology predictions across the board, with ViaSat, 3CX, CCA and Turbonomic appearing on _IT Pro_ with their forecasts for the coming year. Sticking with the enterprise technology press, the Fruition team explored ways to drive the everything-as-a-service revolution in _Information Age_, while on _Real Business_, iPass discussed the real cost of connecting mobile workers.

Rounding up an impressive start to the year, the Elsevier team placed an article on the role of 3D printing in manufacturing with P_roduct Design & Development_.
