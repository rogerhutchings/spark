[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)As always, here at Spark, we don’t do things by half measures. To start the week, Huntsman Security and Bit9 were both featured in a _BBC Online_ security feature. JDA stole the show in _Retail Week’s_ warehousing supplement, appearing in two separate articles. The Trustmarque team secured coverage in publications including _CloudTech_ and _IT Pro Portal_ following new research that found that IT has become both more complicated according to UK CIOs. Elsewhere, Tony Pepper, CEO at Egress gave his expert opinion in _The Register_ following the news that UK doctors and nurses routinely share sensitive patient information via smartphones that are vulnerable to hacks. And finally, expert comment from Centiro’s Niklas Hedin was featured _eDelivery _in response to introduction of the new Consumer Rights Act.

Who gets your vote this week?
