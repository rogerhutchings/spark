![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)It’s September, and the days are getting shorter, and the kids are back to school – making the morning commute even more arduous. However, it’s not all doom and gloom as although the seasons change, Spark continues to harvest a bumper crop of media coverage.

The Trustmarque team led the charge, securing two pieces of coverage in _The Times’ _Future of Healthcare supplement. Not to be outdone, IOActive achieved coverage in _The Times’_ Future of Transport supplement - while, HCL’s opinion on robotic process automation was featured in the publication’s Future of Outsourcing supplement. Elsewhere, the Dynatrace team secured a briefing with the _BBC _to discuss the company’s retail benchmarking report and reaped the rewards with a fantastic piece of online coverage.

As the sky turns overcast, its seems fitting that the Trustmarque’s focused on cloud with coverage on _Computing_, _CBR_ and _Cloud Tech_. Moving away from the cloud, Verizon’s IoT report was carried by _Data Economy_ and the findings of Huntsman’s FoI requests covered by _Local Government Executive_. Elsewhere, the Venafi team was quick to respond to Google’s use of encryption – achieving coverage on _Business Reporter._

Lastly, but by no means least -  Carbon Black responded to hackers targeting the US elections, securing coverage on _Infosecurity_, while ViaSat’s blog on removing latency as a satellite broadband concern was carried by _Capacity_.
