[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)The last week has seen the Spark team firing on all cylinders and racking up some really impressive coverage for a number of clients. First of all the release of Verizon’s 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report saw a fantastic 29 pieces of coverage including _The Guardian, BBC _and_ FT. _Coverage covered a wide range of angles from the relatively small danger of mobile malware to the staggering speed that phishing emails take to ensnare victims. Verizon were closely followed by Egress this week, who managed to secure 14 pieces for from a Freedom of Information request detailing the lack of cybersecurity employed by top law firms in the UK, with stories appearing in _The Register _and_ Computing _amongst others. Next up, JDA had some excellent hits including _The Independent, Retail Week _and_ Internet Retailing _based on the findings of the company's latest retail CEO study. Finally, Ampersand’s Head of Content Strategy Rebecca Martin had an interesting byline on _Marketing Tech_ looking at about the impact of the sharing economy and personalisation on marketers.
