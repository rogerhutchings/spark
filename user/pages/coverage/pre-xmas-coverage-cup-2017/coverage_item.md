With Christmas fast approaching there has been a sack full of client coverage over the last few weeks. Star performers were the SAP User Group team who managed PR around the User Group’s annual conference, UKISUG Connect. This resulted in media coverage the likes of _diginomica_, _Computer Weekly_, _CBR_ and _The Register_, all of which helped pushed the User Group’s current agenda with SAP.

Black Friday and Christmas shopping in general were also a great source of topical client coverage. First in the queue were the RSA team, who successfully pitched its Black Friday cybersecurity stats to _BBC News Online_, followed by the Couchbase and Retail Pro teams whose commentary was included on _Internet Retailing_ and _A1 Retail_ respectively. Not to be outdone, the Centiro team’s media alert warning UK retailers not to drop the ball when it comes to juggling delivery services garnered coverage in its key titles – _eDelivery_, _Internet Retailing_ and _Retail Technology Innovation Hub_.

Finally, there was considerable festive cheer in the office with some fantastic national coverage. The HCL team chimed in with coverage in _The Times’_ IoT supplement, which included the company’s latest global IoT adoption research. Elsewhere the iPass team’s stockings were filled with coverage in the _Daily Mail_ (twice), _The Times_, _Independent_ and _Global News Canada_, following the launch of the company’s Mobile Professionals Report.

If you have managed to survive Christmas puns and read this far – the best of our recent client coverage is opposite.
