![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)In the wake of Valentine’s Day last week, we’ve been spreading the press coverage love recently. The most darling piece of coverage belongs to Bromium, who were the subject of a fantastic article on the _BBC_ - which drew some great parallels between Bromium and characters of the animated film ‘The Incredibles’. _The Times_ included some admirable coverage of HCL with its ‘Talent Management’ feature making use of HCL's comments on how data analysis can be utilised by HR departments.

When you get the right gift, it’s too good not to share, and share Spark did this week with Couchbase customer story appearing in _diginomica_, and research from JDA and Centiro also featuring.

The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) had a sweet week too, releasing the results of a YouGov survey it commissioned, resulting in coverage on _Figaro Digital_ and _The Drum_ – two key marketing publications. Huntsman felt the love too with its comments on UK cyber-attacks being covered by _Information Age_.

Elsevier had a gift in the form of a charming piece of coverage in _Pharmaceutical Technology_. The piece takes an in-depth look at Elsevier’s Hive Project, explaining its aims and methods, and featuring some incredibly enthusiastic quotes from participants in the project. The week’s last gushing piece of coverage was for Servion, who secured coverage in _European Communications _after commenting on_ _EE’s attempts to improve customer service with technology.

This week has definitely produced some coverage worthy of being shouted from the rooftops. A full list of coverage cup nominations can be found below.
