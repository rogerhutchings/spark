![](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)The sun is shining and yet another bank holiday has flown by. Along with dusting off the flip flops, the office took great pleasure in Bromium appearing on _Sky News_ to discuss the WannaCry cyber-attack. Also basking in media coverage was Verizon, for whom WannaCry provided an opportunity for the _BBC_ to cite its malware stats from its most recent DBIR report.

As the UK lit barbecues, MuleSoft had coverage figures to rival the temperature after the successful launch of its Connected Consumer Report, which featured on _Business Insider_, _Insurance Post, Internet Retailing_ and FSTech amongst others. But that wasn’t the end of the glorious coverage (or weather) for MuleSoft, which also saw coverage on d_iginomica_, _CBR_ and _Computer Weekly _following its most recent customer event.

To round up a week of blistering coverage, Compuware warned the majority of businesses are still at risk of being non-compliant when GDPR is implemented next year, with _FX-MM_ and _IT PRO_ picking up the news. And last but not least, JDA and Centiro released their regular Customer Pulse Report which garnered press coverage in the likes of _e-Delivery_, T_he _Grocer, and _Drapers_ to name but a few.

A selection of the week's highlights is below:
