Along with dusting off the flip flops, the office took great pleasure in Bromium appearing on _Sky News_ to discuss the WannaCry cyber-attack. Also basking in media coverage was Verizon, for whom WannaCry provided an opportunity for the _BBC_ to cite its malware stats from its most recent DBIR report.

But that wasn’t the end of the glorious coverage (or weather) for MuleSoft, which also saw coverage on d_iginomica_, _CBR_ and _Computer Weekly _following its most recent customer event.

To round up a week of blistering coverage, Compuware warned the majority of businesses are still at risk of being non-compliant when GDPR is implemented next year, with _FX-MM_ and _IT PRO_ picking up the news. And last but not least, JDA and Centiro released their regular Customer Pulse Report which garnered press coverage in the likes of _e-Delivery_, T_he _Grocer, and _Drapers_ to name but a few.
