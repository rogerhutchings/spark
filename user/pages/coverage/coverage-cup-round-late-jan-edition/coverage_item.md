![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)The UK weather has provided a tumultuous January, with thunder-snow, flooding and the occasional rare glimpse of sunshine. But at Spark, our days have been far more settled, with some great coverage pouring in. Venafi lit up the gloomy weather with coverage in _The Telegraph_ and _The Express_, for comment on the news WhatsApp may not be as secure as it encryption suggests. JDA and Centiro helped to raise the coverage tally with their research hitting industry headlines in_ Retail Systems_ and _Logistics Manager _amongst _others_,.

Trustmarque made the news almost as many times as the weather this week, with a customer interview with the Family Building Society featuring on _Computer Weekly_, and news of an extended contract with learndirect receiving coverage on _V3._

Couchbase featured on _Information Age_ with an opinion piece on why going offline could be the next step for mobile applications. And last but by no means least, Elsevier cleared away the gloom with the news of the ‘PHD Challenge’ getting some fantastic coverage from _Life Science Network_. A full list of coverage cup nominations can be found below.
