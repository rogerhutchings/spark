[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Welcome to this week’s slightly late coverage-cup round up! Over the last fortnight we've helped clients achieve some great pieces of coverage in the industry and national press. There was further coverage of iPass' Wi-Fi hotspot research in _The Economist_, the Verizon team achieved inclusion in the _Financial Times_’ feature on ways to fight cyber-crime, while PQ Solutions were featured twice in the _Daily Telegraph_ following interviews with Brian Snow, who was previously an NSA technical director. Elsewhere, the Dynatrace team's news hijacking around a Google DoubleClick failure resulted in excellent coverage on _Business Reporter._ Case studies have also been a great source of coverage, with both Fruition Partners and Egress seeing customer stories being published on _Retail Times_ and _Computer Weekly_ respectively.
