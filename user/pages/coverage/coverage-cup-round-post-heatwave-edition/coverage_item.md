![](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)With the UK basking in a heatwave last week, Spark slapped on the sun cream (in most cases), turned up the air-con and achieved some sizzling client coverage.

Maybe it was the heat, but computer systems seemed to go into meltdown last week, providing the perfect opportunity for eagle-eyed clients to provide some commentary. Tesco's home delivery order system problems saw Centiro and JDA offer industry insight in _The Mirror_ and _The Independent_. Elsewhere, train users saw red when ticket machines UK wide went down, giving Dynatrace the opportunity to comment on the _Daily Express _regarding preventing infrastructure outages.

ViaSat made the most of the news last week, reacting to space sector plans announced in the Queen’s speech, leading to comments on the _BBC_. Also turning up the heat was RSA, who secured an interview between _TEISS_ and the company’s CSO to discuss issues ranging from nation-state hacking to government cybersecurity.

iPass fired off a sizzling byline for _Computer Weekly_, looking at the mistake budget airlines make in not offering Wi-Fi to passengers. Finally, passing up the tropical weather, [Venafi](http://www.venafi.com) spoke with _MicroScope_ about how machine identity will impact on the channel.
