[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)It’s a bumper Coverage Cup round up and security topped the list with Verizon securing coverage in the _Financial Times _with Managing Principal, Laurance Dine warning that professional services companies are one of the most targeted groups and need to take extra precautions. Following on the security theme, Bit9 + Carbon Black Chief Security Strategist, Ben Johnson was featured in _SC Magazine _speaking about the variety and scope of ransomware threats that businesses are facing. Next up, the iPass team secured a number of pieces of coverage off the back of its Business Traveller Connectivity Index which highlighted that business travellers were overspending £855 million on connectivity charges. This included coverage on _CBR_ and _TechWeek Europe_ amongst others. Finally, Dynatrace's Michael Allen’s bylined article digital transformation was successfully placed on _Information Age_.
