[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Over the last fortnight, we have been involved in some interesting news hijacking activity. The ViaSat team were able to offer comment on the discovery of a major four-year cyber espionage operation, which resulted in coverage in _InfoSecurity_. While the Trace One team sold-in comment around the French governmentâ€™s proposal to enforce the traffic light nutritional labelling system on traditional confectionery, which resulted in coverage in both _Food Processing Technology_ and _Food and Drink Technology_.

Elsewhere, we have also seen a number of excellent national pieces of coverage. For example, Verizon were included in an in-depth feature in _The Guardian_ on how to keep children safe online, offering their advice to parents. In the meantime, we also placed a range of opinion pieces in publications ranging from _TechRadar Pro_ to _Drug Discovery and Development _magazine!_
