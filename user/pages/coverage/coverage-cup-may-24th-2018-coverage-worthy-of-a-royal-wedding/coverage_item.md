Was there a wedding this weekend? Of course there was! However, the night before Harry and Meghan tied the knot, the Spark team had started the celebrations early with a cold drink in the sunshine following another stellar fortnight of coverage.

The Viasat team was busy with not one but two partnership releases in the same week! The satellite comms company made headlines with _Reuters_ covering its internet providing partnership with Scandinavian airline, SAS. Not a team to rest on its laurels, they also secured some great coverage in _Aviation Week_ with the announcement that Viasat will be working with US giant Honeywell to provide internet on business jets across the globe.

Meanwhile, the Bromium team was hard at work securing some top tier coverage. An issues response on the National Crime Agency’s report into organised crime proved fruitful, with _Computer Weekly_, _Infosecurity_ and _TEISS_ covering the news and including commentary from Bromium’s industry expert. The team also managed to secure not one but two backlinks to the company website in a blockbuster piece in _The Guardian_ about money laundering, drawing from Bromium’s recent ‘Web of Profit’ report.

The Elsevier team were on the case with a media alert about reducing animal testing in the pharmaceuticals industry – what a great cause! So good in fact, that that it was covered by _Drug Discovery & Development_, _Pharma Times_ and _The Pharma Letter_, amongst others. 

The HCL Technologies team dominated this month’s edition of _Gigabit’s_ online magazine with a whopper nine-page spread following a briefing with HCL’s Corporate VP & CTO of IT Services, Kalyan Kumar, looking at where the AI industry is heading.

This regal array of coverage was the perfect way to start royal celebrations for the Spark team, and I am sure there were a few sore heads the next morning as the team settled in to watch the wedding.
