[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)It’s been two long weeks since the last Coverage Cup with a General Election throwing up more than a few surprises. Bell Integration CTO was featured in _Computing _warning about the dangers of costly delays to IT implementations while the dust settles. At a European level, Centiro offered its thoughts on the EU’s plans for a single digital market in _eDelivery_. Away from the world of politics, Trustmarque featured heavily in a _TechRadar Pro _piece discussing the implications of IT spending tightening up globally and what companies could do to mitigate any adverse effects. Finally Bit9 + Carbon Black saw coverage in the likes of _SC Magazine _and _Infosecurity,_ with its survey looking at how prepared companies are for Windows Server 2003 end of life_._
