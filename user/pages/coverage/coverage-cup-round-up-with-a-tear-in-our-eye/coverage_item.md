The days are getting longer, the weather seems to be getting warmer, and two out of three months of winter are out of the way. The perfect time to start thinking of spring, of new beginnings, and of fresh coverage.

A key ingredient of successful PR is being able to talk about new and ongoing issues that affect the way we live and work. This means not only repeating received wisdom but adding something new to the conversation. In January, the ever-present topic of Artificial Intelligence was a jumping off point for both MuleSoft, with a Tristan-secured piece in _diginomica_ encapsulating the technology’s shortcomings; and Pia, who secured multiple pieces for Pistoia Alliance investigating AI’s role in pharma. 

Other, issues raised their head as well; with 3CX discussing the looming shut-off of the UKs ISDN networks in _Microscope_ and Venafi explaining the implications of the PSD2 banking regulation to _Computer Business Review_. 

January has had a steady source of breaking news stories – and spotting these, identifying how clients can respond in a way that adds to the story, and getting that response to journalists in double time once more was a core section of our work. From new client Ivalua commenting to the Carillion crisis, to encryption certificate vulnerabilities that sparked Venafi’s attention, the middle of the month proved fertile ground.

These stories carried on into the next week – the continuing rise of motor insurance costs provided some excellent financial coverage for Quadient, whilst NHS Wales IT failures gave Dynatrace an opportunity to comment. And a trio of security stories at the start of the week, raising the spectre of an increased threat from Russia, the inevitability of a cyber-attack against the UK’s critical infrastructure and rising crime statistics us to add clients’ voices to an important debate, with pieces in _Information Age_, _SC Media_, _Energy Voice_, _Computer Business Review_ and _Computer Weekly_ for Huntsman Security, Bromium, RSA and Venafi.

Of course, PR is about more than breaking news – it’s about adding to important, ongoing issues. There was still room for Spark to create stories by taking clients’ own news and explaining its significance for industries – such as great results from JDA research, and a key Viasat contract placed with _Aerospace Technology_. Yet perhaps the most bittersweet cup nomination was for Russell, for an _IT Pro_ Comparex feature and marking his last nomination before he heads off for pastures new in British Columbia. Good luck Russ!

If you’d like to see any of these pieces in detail, look no further than to the right:
