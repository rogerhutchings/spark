[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Another good week of client coverage here at Spark. First of all, Fruition Partners and Guavus both featured in _The Times_ ‘Future of Outsourcing’ supplement after some successful pitching by their resepctive teams. Next up, the Trustmarque team secured two great pieces in _Computing_ and _E-Health Insider_, looking at how the company is implementing new software for Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh (WWL) NHS Trust. Finally, the Dynatrace team placed a fascinating opinion piece with _Global Banking & Finance Review_ on the future of customer-centric banking and the implications for IT departments.
