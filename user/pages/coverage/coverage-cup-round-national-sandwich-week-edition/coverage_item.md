It was National Sandwich Week a couple of weeks ago – and to celebrate Spark filled the news with layer upon layer of mouth-watering client coverage.

Elsevier was the first to take a bite of coverage cherry, commenting on the need for drug development to combat rare diseases in _The Times_. But Elsevier wasn’t dining alone, with The Pistoia Alliance also featuring in _The Times_, discussing the need for industry collaboration to improve drug pricing. Heaping on the coverage, The Pistoia Alliance’s call for wearable device standards in clinical trials was also the subject of a piece on _Clinical Informatics News_.

Dynatrace and Verizon both cut through the competition commenting on the breaking news of the day. Dynatrace featured on the _BBC_ explaining the cause of the WhatsApp outage and _TEISS_ made use of Verizon’s recent DBIR statistics for its piece on the ransomware attack on Telefonica.

The Bromium team also helped themselves to a slice of the action by commenting on the Telefonica hack in _Computer Business Review_. Served on the side was additional coverage in _Information Age_ after Bromium revealed that cybersecurity professionals have been paying ransoms to attackers. It was also a jam-packed week of coverage for Fruition, with news of a partnership with Crossrail featuring on _Information Age_ and _Computer Weekly._

To wrap up a plate of succulent coverage, Acqueon commented on news that the ICO handed out a record fine to a nuisance call centre in _Contact Centres_.

As usual, a full list of coverage can be found opposite.
