It may have been a Bank Holiday weekend, but at Spark we haven’t let the shorter weeks get in the way of some great client coverage.

First to join in the fun was the Chartered Institute of Marketing, whose research was covered in _City AM_, and its comments on digital advertising and personalisation appearing on the _BBC_ and _The Times_ respectively.

Verizon made the most of the shortened week, getting its comments on cybersecurity featured in the _Financial Times_. But they weren’t the only ones, with the _Financial Times_ also publishing a ‘Letter to the Editor’ on research and development productivity from Elsevier.

Liberata popped up on _WalesOnline_ with news of its new automation hub opening in Cardiff. Elsewhere MuleSoft shared its opinion on the triggering of Article 50 in _Computer Business Review_ and _Computer Weekly_.

Not ones to miss the fun, IOActive was the subject of a video interview this week on _Infosecurity_, while last, but by no means least, Couchbase featured on _Information Age_ with an opinion piece on the digital revolution.
