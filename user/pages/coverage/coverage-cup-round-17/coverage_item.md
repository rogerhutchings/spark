![](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)In honour of International Beer Day, Spark served up barrels of coverage.

IOActive guzzled up the coverage, with company's Segway hack gaining coverage on _WIRED_. Giddy with success, IOActive contributed to a _BBC Online_ article on a new GCHQ report on industrial hacking. Joining the round of national coverage was the RSA team, who spotted news of a phishing website targeting Newcastle University students. This resulted in coverage on _BBC News, The Times_ and _The Register _amongst others_._

Next to order up coverage was GMC Software, whose comments on the latest PPI news was featured in the _International Business Times_. Not one for pint-size coverage, Elsevier went big with a thought leadership piece on the needs of 21st Century researchers with _Research Information_.

As the coverage poured in, a Pistoia Alliance opinion piece on the need for collaboration in the life science industry hopped onto _Drug Discovery and Development._ Brewed to perfection, Huntsman released the results of an FOI request into the misuse of data by police forces, leading to great pieces on _Government Technology_ and _The Register_.

The final serving of coverage came courtesy of the Servion team, who spotted an ICO ruling against MoneySupermarket and took the opportunity to comment on the news in _The Drum_.

A full list of this week’s coverage can be found below:
