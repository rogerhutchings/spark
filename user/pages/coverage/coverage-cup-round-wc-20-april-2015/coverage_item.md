[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)The General Election is only a week away, but here at Spark there is only one vote worth winning and that is the Coverage Cup! This week the Spark team gained coverage for Tier-3, ViaSat and Bit9 + Carbon Black by hijacking a story about the security concerns surrounding the Network Rail upgrade, this included coverage in _The Register, Infosecurity _and _ITProPortal._ Following that up, the Elsevier team secured placement of a two-part byline in _E&P_ regarding the importance of data in finding new oil and gas reserves. Elsewhere, HCL’s Senior VP, Sukamal Banerjee gave his thoughts on Industrial IoT regulation following an interview the team secured with Land Mobile. Finally, the SAP User Group, achieved a number of pieces, including _diginomica_, _Computer Weekly_ and _ComputerworldUK_, following a survey looking at the challenges facing organisations when it comes to optimising their SAP landscape.
