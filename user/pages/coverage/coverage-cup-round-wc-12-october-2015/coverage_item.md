[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Another week at Spark, another bumper crop of coverage. First of all iPass’ CEO Gary Griffiths appeared on _BBC_’s ‘Business Live’ programme which was a great piece of broadcast coverage. The Huntsman and Bit 9 + Carbon Black teams had their fingers on the pulse, responding to the Dridex UK bank hack to achieve coverage in _CBR_.  The Bit 9 + Carbon Black team also secured interviews for the company's Chief Evangelist Ben Johnson with both_ Computing_ and _Computer Weekly_. Elsewhere, a Fruition Partners’ case study with NHS Education for Scotland was covered by _Computing and CBR_. In addition, an interview on the partnership was also secured within ComputerWeekly, so an excellent result all round.
