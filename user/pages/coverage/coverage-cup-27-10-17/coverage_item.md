The Bromium team started off the bids for the Coverage Cup, claiming a briefing with security publication _TEISS_, which resulted in a nice piece on their survey of CISOs. Quick to put their claim forward was the JDA and Centiro teams after hard fought coverage of the regular Customer Pulse report, for which the teams gained a bumper 11 pieces of coverage, including _Post and Parcel_ and _Retail Technology Innovation Hub_ which earned Will his nomination. 

There was a spirited defence from the Elsevier team, who wanted to claim the cup for themselves for several pieces; notably a Letter to the Editor on the niche subject of the Chemistry Noble prize which was published in the _Financial Times_. The team also held up the research on the state of the chemistry industry, which was successfully pitched into top science publication _Chemistry World_, and was also supported by an interview with one of the researchers. 

The JDA team countered this coverage with a fantastic effort from Aimee, who succeeded in getting JDA into a _Retail Week_ supplement in multiple features. But quick to fight back was Dom, with a nomination for news of ViaSat’s legal action against Inmarsat which was covered by the _Financial Times_ – in both print and online as Dom was quick to point out. Rob was keen to put in a self-nomination – normally against the rules but allowed with the rest of the SAP User Group team out of the office – for well-deserved coverage in _Tech Radar Pro_ after several bouts of chasing. 

It was a close call, but the cup is safely resting on a desk in the office. Can you guess whose?
