[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)It was all about by-lined articles last week with four separate Coverage Cup nominations. First up, the Elsevier team managed a double placement in _Oilfield Technology _and _World Oil _speaking about the way in which technology is enabling a new wave of resource exploration by processing the vast quantities of data generated. Next up, we helped secure an interesting piece in _SC Magazine_ on behalf of Bit9 + Carbon Black’s David Flower commenting on the need for layered defences. Rounding out the by-lined article rush, We worked with Verizon to secure the placement of an article in _Cloud Computing Intelligence _for Verizon’s Cloud Director Gavan Egan about what companies need to consider when choosing a cloud service. Outside of the by-lined article world, the Centiro team continued to secure coverage of the previous week's news hijacking of the EU's plans for a Digital Single Market, this time securing coverage in _Retail Week._
