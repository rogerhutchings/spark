In case you hadn’t noticed, the football World Cup kicked off last week. The world watched while Russia opened the tournament with a thumping 5-0 victory over Saudi Arabia, and Ronaldo wowed us with a last gasp free kick to complete his hat-trick and a 3-all draw with Spain. Meanwhile the Spark team was busy scoring a few goals of its own with some great coverage across the fortnight.

The Pistoia Alliance team had an impressive couple of weeks, crowned by a brilliant piece in _City AM_ about trialling Alzheimer drugs, which came off the back of a briefing with the company’s president. The team also secured coverage from research on AI adoption in the life sciences sector, with stories from _Pharma Voice_ and _Pharma Integrates_.

Couchbase’s Connect event went down a storm; with pieces in _ComputerWorld UK_ and _diginomica_ following interviews about Couchbase’s role as an ‘engagement database’ with the company’s CEO, and customers including Centrica, at the show. CEO interviews were also popular with the Venafi team, which secured on-message articles from _Computer Weekly_ and _TEISS_ discussing how vital encryption is in the modern world. Some quick thinking from the Venafi team also resulted in _The Independent_ publishing a letter to the editor on the importance of encryption in the wake of HM chief inspector, Thomas Winsor, discussing increased regulation on encryption. 

Ivalua had a fantastic, in-depth case study on its work with Maxim Healthcare Services published by _diginomica_, highlighting how Ivalua’s procurement solution was superior to one of the company’s main competitors and positioning Ivalua as a market leader. 

The Quadient team rounded off the fortnight with a great piece of news hijacking coverage from _International Banking Systems Journal_ around the impact of bank branch closures on customers.

All in all, it was another stellar week from the Spark team, with a huge range of coverage secured. With England off to a winning start in the World Cup, and many of their rivals failing at that task, things are looking golden here at Spark. Could football be coming home?
