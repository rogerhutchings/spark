[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Welcome to this week’s Coverage Cup round up! We’ve had some great pieces this week, including the JDA team successfully securing an opinion piece on _The Guardian_’s sustainable business section, looking at how 3D printing is set to shake up manufacturing supply chains. The Guavus team also placed an opinion piece on _European Communications_ on how operators must integrate RAN and business analytics to strategically guide LTE spending. Elsewhere, the Dynatrace team jumped on the back of the Black Friday frenzy, and ran a successful news hijack on the need for better website performance, resulting in coverage on _CBR_ and _Retail Times._ In addition, Verizon published its’ top enterprise technology trends for 2015, resulting in coverage on _Total Telecom_ and _Business Reporter_. while the Tier-3 team offered comment around The IET’s ‘Ones to Watch’ report, resulting in coverage on _Infosecurity _and _V3._
