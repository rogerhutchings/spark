[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Last week the UK had to batten down the hatches as Spark took the press by storm achieving a bucket load of excellent coverage throughout the week. First off, Trace One achieved national coverage in _New Day_ for FOI results from the NHS, which showed a significant rise in allergies across the country, a great hit from a new national newspaper. The storm didn’t show any signs of stopping with Carbon Black securing coverage on the _BBC_; not once but twice!  

Byline coverage was secured Fruition Partner’s Paul Cash, where he explained why IT departments should use analytics to dissect data on _TechWeekEurope. _Feature coverage was then secured for GMC in the _Insurance Post_ quoting spokesperson Mike Davies throughout the article alongside other leading industry experts. To end a very successful week Trustmarque’s work with Natural Resources Wales was covered in _PublicTechnology.net_, whilst _Network World_ included ElasticHosts in their weekly products round up.
