The January blues might be trying to break their way in, but here at Spark we’ve been aiming for something bigger and brighter – the next coverage cup victory. 

Even before Christmas, there was no slowing down – whether it was sharing predictions for the year ahead or putting out news that gave some light relief going into the holidays. For instance, the Couchbase, Servion and Mulesoft teams placed predictions with _CBR_, _Cloud Tech_, and _Information Age_.

At the same time, the Persado team secured coverage in key marketing press – with both _Campaign_ and _Netimperative_ fascinated by the news that, when it comes to reacting to email, US, UK and European consumers act very much like the stereotypes of their various leaders. 

Some might see the first week back from the holidays as a chance to ease back into the swing of things. However, at Spark it seemed there’d been a host of resolutions to Get More National Coverage. Russell and Cathy kicked things off, with a new Compuware integration covered in _Forbes_. Not to be outdone, Michelle swiftly secured Servion’s predictions on Artificial Intelligence a _BBC_ piece, with the same story also making the _Express_. 

Gus followed this with a one-two punch of his own, giving Bromium “epic” coverage from _Sky News_ and the _Daily Mail_ thanks to its response to the Spectre and Meltdown security and performance issues facing Intel chips. In the meantime, Tom placed Dynatrace’s Chief Marketing Officer at the heart of a _CNBC_ article on the disruption CMOs face – the article may have been sponsored by Accenture, but Dynatrace very much lead the way.  

Of course, a single week of national coverage might not prove anything – which is why Spark carried its momentum across the weekend. Pia struck with an in-depth dissection of the Dark Web from Venafi in _International Business Times_, while Gus continued his streak with an IOActive warning on Bitcoin in the _Independent_. 

Yet while national coverage is always more than welcome, it’s important for us to remember that many clients’ audiences are best reached through the specialist press. Aimee made this perfectly clear for Quadient, with a response to the news of the new Open Banking revolution making waves in _FSTech_ – one of the key finance titles.

Of course, all the above only scratches the surface of the coverage – but some of the best pieces are right opposite.
