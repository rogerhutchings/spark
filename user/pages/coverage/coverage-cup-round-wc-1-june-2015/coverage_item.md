[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)A week of news from the Spark team with JDA, Centiro, ViaSat UK and Egress all being covered in national titles. To start things off, both JDA and Centiro appeared in _The Independent _and _The Mirror, _in addition to a host of trade titles, for their research looking at consumer woes when it comes to online shopping. Secondly, through an ICO FOI request ViaSat UK discovered that thousands of data breaches are going unreported compared to how many devices are actaully stolen. The resulting media outreach from the team helped secure coverage on _PA _and _Business Reporter _among others. Last but not least, Egress werenâ€™t going to miss out on the FOI action. Its request revealed that there had been a tripling in data incidents in the financial sector over the last two years. This resulted in coverage in both the _Financial Times _and _Daily Mail_.
