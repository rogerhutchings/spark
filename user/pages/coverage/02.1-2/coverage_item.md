With the sun finally making an appearance this month, and temperatures slowly creeping towards double digits, Spark has been celebrating the onset of spring with a bloom of coverage.

The first coverage to sprout was courtesy of The Independent, which featured comment from our new client, Servion, regarding voice recognition security in banking. Huntsman and RSA were not far behind, both making it onto the BBC website with a comment on cyber warfare, and a profile piece in honour of International Women’s Day respectively.

IOActive saw coverage blooming with its comments making it into the news stories in The Daily Mail and The Independent. And that wasn’t all for IOActive who were also featured in a Financial Times story which looking at how consumer IoT devices could be hacked. The Chartered Institute of Marketing also sprouted coverage on CNBC and The Drum after releasing a report on the challenges and opportunities for marketers in 2017.

Bromium burst into the news with an array of coverage after discovering that many of the world’s best-known robots can be hacked. The news made it into the UK and US print editions of the Financial Times amongst others.

Last but by no means least, GMC received coverage in Banking Technology for an opinion article looking at the necessity of banking apps and how these can impact on customer experience. All in all a vibrant couple of weeks for Spark.
