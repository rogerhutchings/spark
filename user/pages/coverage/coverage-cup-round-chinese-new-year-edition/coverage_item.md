[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Nín hǎo, and welcome to the first Coverage Cup post of the Chinese new year. This year is the year of the monkey, but Spark has refrained from monkey business in the pursuit of a bananas amount of coverage.

JDA and Verizon split the prize for national coverage as both teams secured great pieces in the _Financial Times._ JDA’s Razat Gaurav highlighted the latest risks impacting global supply chains while Verizon commented on the state of the cyber insurance industry.

After the team successfully set up a briefing, HCL's Prithvi Shergill was featured on _HR Magazine, _talking about 'employee-led organisations'_. _While _Employee Benefits _covered the news that HCL had been certified a Top Employer for the tenth year in a row.

Finally, the ViaSat team swinging into action to secure a feature length article on ZDNet regarding what ViaSat-3 means for the future of satellite broadband. This was arguably the pick of the bunch, with the journalist going ape about the story on Twitter.

A full list of coverage cup nominations can be found below:
