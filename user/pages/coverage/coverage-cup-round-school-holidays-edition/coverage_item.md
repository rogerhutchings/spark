![](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)The school summer holidays may be coming to an end, but it has been business as usual for the Spark team in terms of client media coverage.

First to help themselves to the buffet of coverage was Venafi, whose letter to the editor re: comments made by the Home Secretary on Brexit, was featured in _The Independent_. MuleSoft was the next to the coverage party after the team secured a briefing between the company's founder and d_iginomica_ to discuss the importance of API-led connectivity.

Fruition also joined fun, achieving coverage on _Compare the Cloud_ for a byline considering how CIO’s can ‘tame’ cloud. Also in the game was Centiro, whose comments on the launch of Amazon Hub were featured on _Business Review USA_.

Finally, Elsevier had a byline on the importance of green chemistry featuring in _Laboratory News, _and 3CX’s acquisition of Askozia made it onto _Channelnomics._

A full list of this week’s coverage can be found below.
