![](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)As campaigning ended and Britain went to the polls, Spark was working as hard as ever to achieve the best coverage for our clients.

The first cross in the coverage box this week went to ViaSat, who announced the launch of the world’s highest capacity communications satellite, ViaSat-2\. The news featured in the _BBC_, _International Business Times_ and _The Register._ Not ones to be outdone, both Couchbase and Acqueon had comment feature in _The Times’_ ‘The Future CMO 2017’ supplement.

Also in the running for coverage cup, RSA discussed what the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means for businesses, with its comments quoted in _City A.M._ Huntsman had a successful week, commenting in _CloudPro_ on the news of a US intelligence leak at the hands of a defence contractor. 3CX also found success as it looked to the future with a byline article on the need for CIO’s to be software agnostic, which appeared on _Information Age_.

Finally, Fruition joined the roll-call of coverage with news on the company’s partnership with Crossrail featuring on _ComputerWorld_, while Venafi’s survey on lax cybersecurity practices in the financial industry appeared on _FX-MM._
