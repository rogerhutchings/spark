![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)With the sun finally making an appearance this month, and temperatures slowly creeping towards double digits, Spark has been celebrating the onset of spring with a bloom of coverage.

The first coverage to sprout was courtesy of _The Independent, _which featured comment from our new client, Servion, regarding voice recognition security in banking. Huntsman and RSA were not far behind, both making it onto the _BBC _website with a comment on cyber warfare, and a profile piece in honour of International Women's Day respectively.

IOActive saw coverage blooming with its comments making it into the news stories in _The Daily Mail_ and _The Independent._ And that wasn’t all for IOActive who were also featured in a _Financial Times_ story which looking at how consumer IoT devices could be hacked. The Chartered Institute of Marketing also sprouted coverage on _CNBC_ and _The Drum_ after releasing a report on the challenges and opportunities for marketers in 2017.

Bromium burst into the news with an array of coverage after discovering that many of the world’s best-known robots can be hacked. The news made it into the UK and US print editions of the _Financial Times _amongst others.

Last but by no means least, GMC received coverage in _Banking Technology_ for an opinion article looking at the necessity of banking apps and how these can impact on customer experience. All in all a vibrant couple of weeks for Spark.
