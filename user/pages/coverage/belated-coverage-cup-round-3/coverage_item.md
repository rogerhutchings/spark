[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Another great week of coverage at Spark. First off, the ViaSat team reacted quickly to the latest update from Broadband Delivery UK, and were rewarded with coverage in _Computer Weekly_. The Verizon team also achieved coverage in _Computer Weekly_ off the back of the company's latest cloud computing report. Elsewhere, a Changepoint article on project management for CIOs appeared on _Information Age_, while the Guavus team successfully pitched in comment for _Capacity's_ article on network-as-a-service. Finally, the JDA team secured two great pieces of coverage on _Essential Retail,_ after securing the publication's attendance at JDA's recent FocusConnect event.
