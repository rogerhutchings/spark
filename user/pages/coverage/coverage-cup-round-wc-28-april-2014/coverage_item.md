[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Last week's Coverage Cup was an extremely competitive affair. There were some great results achieved; notably in the FT Connected Business with several clients quoted in its April issue focusing on cybersecurity. In addition, the ViaSatUK team got some great results from its latest Freedom of Information (FOI) request.
