[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)This week coverage was secured across a number of key media titles. Egress was quick to respond to WhatsApp announcing end-to-end encryption with the company's CEO Tony Pepper quoted in _CBR_. The Verizon team also achieved _CBR_ coverage for its IoT report which asserted that the Internet of Things network has finally gone mainstream. The Dynatrace team set up a briefing with _Cloud Tech_, which resulted in a brilliant in-depth article on the challenge of managing performance through SDI. Finally, Elsevier was quoted in an _Internet of Business_’ article on wearables being used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
