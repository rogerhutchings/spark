[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Welcome to this week’s Coverage Cup round up! The ViaSat UK team began the week with a news hijack on the Ministry of Justice’s fine from the ICO which resulted in coverage in _Computing _and_ Computer Weekly_. In addition, there were a number of successful byline placements across several accounts - the Compuware team placed a Mainframe opinion piece on the EU Data Protection Directive with _ITProPorta_l, while the JDA team secured an article on the challenges posed by the rise of online shopping and the convergence of digital and physical supply chains with _Retail Technology_. Below is a selection of some of last week's highlights:
