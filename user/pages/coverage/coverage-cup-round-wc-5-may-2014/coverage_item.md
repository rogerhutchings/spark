[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Last week saw airports across the UK struck by an IT glitch, forcing travellers to wait in long and extremely frustrating queues overnight.  Identifying this as a potential news-hijacking opportunity for one of our clients (Compuware), which specialises in technology performance, we were able to get some good results in the IT and travel media.  

These and a number of successfully placed opinion pieces were amongst last week's Coverage Cup nominations.  Which of the below do you think deserved to win?
