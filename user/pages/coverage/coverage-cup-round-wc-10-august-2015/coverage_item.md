[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)A great week of coverage from the Spark team, underpinned by some interesting research from Trustmarque looking at technology usage in the NHS. Due to the team's pitching efforts, there as some fantastic coverage of the research in the likes of _City A.M., Business Reporter, Computer Weekly _and _Digital Health_. Elsewhere, the Bell Integration team successfully pitched comment to _CBR_ from the company's CTO Andy Soames offering some words of caution for companies like Netflix, who are moving entirely to the public cloud_. _Meanwhile, the iPass team achieved some great coverage in the enterprise IT and telecoms press off the back of the company's partnership with Devicescape._ _Finally, _Cloud Computing Intelligence_ ran a recent interview with Elastichosts CEO Richard Davies, who discussed how companies can use the cloud for disaster recovery.

The full list of Coverage Cup nominations for the week is below:
