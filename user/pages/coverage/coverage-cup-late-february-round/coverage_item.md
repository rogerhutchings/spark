[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)February has almost come to an end, but there has been plenty of Spark client coverage over the last couple of weeks. First up, the JDA team secured not one, but two hits in _The Times_ with some excellent insight into how technology is altering how supply chains operate and how to remove the increasing risks. Next up, the Verizon team successfully news hijacked the RBS/Natwest fingerprint ID story by providing wider context for the adoption of biometrics and what still needs to happen. This resulted in coverage in _CBR _and _ProSecurityZone_. Finally, the ElasticHosts team placed a byline in _Risk UK_ from the company's CEO Richard Davies about how businesses can procure cost-effective disaster recovery at a time when it is more necessary than ever before.
