[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)A bumper crop of coverage from the last two weeks across a range of clients. First of all ElasticHosts debuted its new cloud hosting service Springs.io, achieving coverage in the likes of _Silicon Angle, Computer Weekly _and _V3._ Research from Fruition Partners on the dangers of shadow IT and the problems of losing control for CIOs and resulted in coverage in _Computer Business Review, Computing _and _Business Cloud News _amongst others. Finally, a successful news hijack saw Dynatrace's Michael Allen commenting on the Ofcom Communications Report in _ITProPortal_ and _Business Reporter _on how businesses cannot afford to miss the opportunity from mobile marketing.

A full list of the Coverage Cup nominations is below. Which is your winner?
