[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Welcome to this week’s Coverage Cup round up,  featuring our top hits from the last week.  It was an outstanding week for national coverage – resulting in happy clients and a hotly contested debate in the office over who should win the coveted coverage cup.   We are a competitive bunch and love the kudos that comes with a piece in the nationals. 

There is a nice mix of proactive pitching, issues response, features and interviews so opinion was divided on which was the most difficult to secure and therefore who should win.  Coverage in the nationals is usually as a result of persistence, speed, detective work and a little bit of luck so great to see that tenacity paying off.

For the Egress team, running an issues response on Dropbox’s supposed hack, spotting the story early and collaborating with the client to come up with a quick response resulted in coverage in the _Daily Mail Online_ and _The Telegraph_.  The quote was also used by the _Press Association_ leading to over 40 pieces of regional news stories. We managed to beat off the competition in the security sector that were no doubt clamouring to be included – an excellent result for a fairly new client we are working to build thought leadership for.

For Virtusa, it was about building a story that was strong enough to pitch as a proactive briefing with a company spokesperson.  Lauren’s [recent post](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2014/10/22/beware-technology-journalist/) talks about the importance of helping the spokesperson deliver on what you’ve promised; in the case of proactive pitching, it is particularly important that you deliver what the journalist is expecting as it is not just one quote they are looking for, they are expecting the spokesperson to shape a whole piece.  The resulting _BBC News Online_ coverage is fantastic. In addition, detective work on features and who was writing them got Virtusa into a _Times_ report on gamification in the workplace.

The PQ team was also focused on demonstrating the credibility and knowledge of their spokesperson, ex-NSA technical director, Brian Snow.  This piece was again a result of building a story that was strong enough to pitch as a proactive briefing.  If the client and agency can effectively work together to anticipate hot topics and build a story around them during regular brainstorming sessions, then the coverage will position companies as thought leaders and result in excellent pieces, such as the below  _Guardian_ piece.
