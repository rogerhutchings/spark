![](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Depending on how much time you spend on the Internet, you might know that last week played host to ice cream day – perfectly timed to coincide with the glorious British weather. To celebrate, Spark has been scooping up the coverage for our clients.

Making a fab (ulous) start was RSA, who managed to make it into not one, but two, national news stories. Firstly, the _BBC_ wrote a piece on the key GDPR issues which came from a recent RSA roundtable. The other dazzling piece of coverage came from _The Independent_, which discussed the cyber security risks of Amazon Prime Day.

Joining the feast, Couchbase had its comments on Amazon Prime Day featured in _Retail Gazette’s_ coverage of the event. Liberata’s coverage was anything but vanilla, after it announced a partnership with Pendle Borough Council, receiving coverage on _Government Technology_ and _Digital by Default News_.

Another scoop came from Couchbase, which commented on digital transformation in a _Sunday Times_ supplement on the data economy in the finance industry_._ And topping things off in the _Sunday Times_ was GMC Software and its comments on the ongoing PPI scandal.

As usual, a full list of Coverage Cup nominations can be found below.
