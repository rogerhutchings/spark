[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Our feet hardly touched the floor last week, with some great coverage results coming in for a variety of clients. Following on from the announcement that HCL and IBM have partnered to foster IoT adoption, fantastic coverage was secured on both _CBR_ and _IT PRO_. Trustmarque showed off its hard work with Coventry & Warwickshire Growth Hub, with case study coverage on _Computer Weekly. _Elsewhere_,_ comment from JDA’s Lee Gill and supporting research stats stats were used in _Retail Week_’s Multichannel supplement. Finally, excellent Byline coverage was secured for Verizon’s Robin Schlee in _Outsourcing Magazine_, Bell Integration’s Andy Soanes on _Information Age_ and last but certainly not least Changepoint’s Jean-Pierre Ullmo on _Channel Pro. _All were giving expert opinion on a range of different and fascinating subjects.
