[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Last week saw a broad mix of client coverage. The iPass team secured a great piece of coverage on the _BBC _as a result of pro-actively pitching a business travel technology feature. Other notable mentions included the Damovo team for some contact centre research featured on _MyCustomer_, while the Guavus team secured a great opinion piece placement on _SC Magazine_. Which piece of coverage do you think deserves to win?
