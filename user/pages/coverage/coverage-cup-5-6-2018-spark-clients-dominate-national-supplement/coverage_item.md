Another fortnight goes by, one in which the Spark team demonstrated some great storytelling and media relations skills with an enormous breadth of coverage, including some fantastic pieces in the nationals, and completely dominating a supplement!

First, was _The Times/Raconteur_ Future Chief Data Officer supplement. With GDPR newly enforced, it was inevitably a hot topic in the report. Spark secured a briefing for both RSA and Couchbase with the author of the GDPR piece – each resulting in some great coverage. Couchbase also managed to get into the supplement intro on the role of the CDO, along with Polymatica. As if that wasn’t enough, Polymatica also made it into a feature on CDOs and ethical business standards. That means three clients got into three separate articles in the same supplement – not bad going!

Meanwhile the Elsevier team managed to respond quickly enough to the news that Theresa May is requesting that the NHS make more use of AI in diagnosing diseases to get coverage, both online and in print, with a letter in _The Guardian_ calling for greater collaboration across industries. 

The Bromium team had another great fortnight, the highlight of which has to be getting comment on why hackers target global events included in a _MailOnline_ feature on hackers targeting the Champions League Final. The team was also hard at work pitching product updates to both the tech and channel press, resulting in coverage with _Intelligent CISO_ and a lovely piece in _CRN_ following a briefing with Bromium’s CEO to cap off a jam-packed week.

Last but certainly not least, Spark got some great coverage around client events. MuleSoft’s London Summit made headlines with _Computerworld UK_ and _Computer Weekly_. Dynatrace’s Perform Europe event went off with a blast following a great piece with _Computerworld UK_. At the same time the team was busy pitching out some CIO research looking into customer experience, achieving 12 pieces from the likes of _CBR_, _Information Age_, _Global Banking & Finance Review_ and _Engage Customer_.

Once again, the whole Spark team had a great fortnight with coverage ranging from channel to national, briefings to research, proving Spark’s full range of skills. The team celebrated with a well-earned drink in the sunshine, making the most of it while it lasts!
