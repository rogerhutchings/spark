![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)With Euro 2016 well underway, Spark continued to score some great client coverage. To kick off, the JDA and Centiro teams recorded fantastic results with Customer Pulse 2016 Report, securing coverage in _The Times_, _Forbes, Business Reporter, Business Insider _and _Internet Retailing_ amongst of others. The Elsevier team remain in a strong position after doing the double with _R&D Magazine and_ _Manufacturing Global_. Trace One made the most of quick delivery (of Brexit comment) to clinch a result in _Packaging News._ Finally, HCL sealed an injury time winner in _IoT Global Network_ for a by-lined article discussing security in the IoT revolution.
