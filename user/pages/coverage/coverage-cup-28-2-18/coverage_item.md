With parts of the UK facing severe snow warnings, it is fair to say there has been an avalanche of client coverage over the last couple of weeks.

First up were some notable successes with _The Times/Raconteur_ supplements. Both RSA and MuleSoft were included in an Open Banking feature in the 'Financial Services Technology' supplement. The MuleSoft team had further reason to celebrate, as comment from the company’s founder Ross Mason made it into the ‘Digital Economy’ supplement for a feature looking at the digital transformation and the boardroom. The Servion team also achieved coverage in the same supplement, in a separate feature looking at AI and customer service. Not to be outdone, Elsevier was featured in the 'Future of Infrastructure' supplement with comments on sustainable cities. All these pieces of coverage are a great example of the team being able to target national journalists quickly with topical and interesting content.

As always we’ve been hijacking the news. The RSA team were at it again, securing national coverage in the _Independent_ and _Mirror_ for two separate news hijacks. Elsewhere the Quadient team also got in on the news hijacking act, with comments included on an _IBS Intelligence_ piece looking at the latest Gartner stats on virtual assistants.

Research continues to be a rich seam of client coverage and last week the MuleSoft team secured a number of pieces across enterprise IT and vertical titles for the company’s 2018 Connectivity Benchmark Report. The team had been working closely with the client throughout the project, from developing the storyline and questions through to writing the report and the associated media relations – the fruits of this labour can be found on _CBR_, _Information Age_, _Enterprise CIO_, _Retail Tech Innovation Hub_ and _IBS Intelligence_ amongst others.

Finally, it wouldn’t be a Coverage Cup round up without some client thought leadership coverage. Over the last two weeks, the team has secured a number of opinion pieces – from iPass talking about the golden age of Wi-Fi data on _CBR_, through to Ivalua highlighting the supplier management lessons learnt from the collapse of Carillion on _Supply Chain Digital_.

The full list of Coverage Cup nominations can be found on the sidebar opposite.
