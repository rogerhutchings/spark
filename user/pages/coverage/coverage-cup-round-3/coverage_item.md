[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)There has been some serious competition among the Spark team for the Coverage Cup over the last two weeks! George Osbourne’s budget pledges around renewable energy were a major talking point for Romonet, who commented on the issue on CBR and _ITProPortal _(alongside other budget comment from Bell, HCL and Dynatrace). Not to be outdone, Bell Integration has an opinion piece on _Information Age, _discussing the implications of the Government's digital tax plans. Next up, research and quotes from Trustmarque feature heavily in a _TechRadar Pro _article about the future of personal cloud after some successful pitching by the team.  Elsewhere, the Centiro team secured an opinion piece in _Internet Retailing _looking at the issue of how do retailers cope with a growing number of online return_s. _Finally, the Guavus team scored a brace with a double hit in the same issue of _Capacity Magazine _with separate quotes about managing the IoT and vendor partnerships.
