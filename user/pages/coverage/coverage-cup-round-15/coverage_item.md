![](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)June is International Mud Month, so Spark has been getting stuck in to sow the seeds for coverage to blossom.

Bromium fought through the mire of competitors to comment in _The Independent_ on rumours that the UK government intends to regulate the internet. Meanwhile, the UK&I SAP User Group brought things down to earth with results from a survey showing SAP users haven’t fully understood the implications of GDPR yet, receiving coverage in _Computer Business Review_ and d_iginomica _amongst others. Elsewhere, Turbonomic dished the dirt on its autonomic cloud management platform to d_iginomica_ and _Data Center Dynamics_.

3CX was on solid ground with a byline on the relevance of unified communications in a digital world featuring on _Computer Weekly_. Finally, the Elsevier team got their hands dirty spreading news of the release of the Reaxys Medicinal Chemistry platform, successfully resulting in coverage on _Technology Networks_.

As usual, a full list of this week’s coverage can be found below.
