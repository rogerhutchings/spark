[Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)Another double Coverage Cup round up this week with a good mix of client coverage. The JDA team secured business press coverage in _The Times _on the subject of low carbon supply chains, while the ViaSat team secured coverage on _BBC Online _following a successful news hijack. There were also a couple of notable opinion piece placements in key vertical press titles including _Research Information _and _Global Banking & Finance Review._
