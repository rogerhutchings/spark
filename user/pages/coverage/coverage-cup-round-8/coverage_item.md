![Coverage cup](Coverage-cup-167x300.jpg)With Summer just around the corner and the blazing sun hanging low in the Western sky, it’s fitting that Spark has embarked on a blinding run of national coverage. Verizon led the charge, securing coverage on both the _BBC _and _Financial Times_ for a report which found email to be the most popular phishing tool. Also, angling for the coveted Spark Coverage Cup was the ViaSat team, who achieved coverage in _Financial Times_ regarding the communications provider partnership with the European Space Agency. The _New Stateman Tech _also covered the announcement – so a great effort all round.

Making hay while the sun shines, The Venafi team struck with lightning reactions, responding to the Qatar National Bank hack and securing comment on _IT Pro_. The JDA team also had its finger on the pulse to respond to BHS entering administration, for which they were rewarded with coverage on _Bloomberg_, E_ssential Retail_ and _Internet Retailing_ amongst others.

The full list of coverage cup nominations can be found below:
