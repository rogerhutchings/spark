first_name: Cathy
last_name: 'O''Neill'
bio: 'Aside from a fanatical love Cher, Big Brother and her cat, ‘Fud’, there’s nothing that Cathy enjoys more than a good story – whether it’s an anecdote down the pub, or a holiday read. This passion translates into great writing and some pretty unforgettable pitches (ask Cathy about her greatest hits over a drink sometime). Primed with a degree in journalism, Cathy relishes the challenge of tackling subjects that most would consider dull, and writing genuinely compelling content and projects. She is always focused on the big picture of how PR can drive tangible business outcomes and meaningful results.'
