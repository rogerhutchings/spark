first_name: Russell
last_name: Cafferty
bio: 'When he’s not dedicating time to his many philanthropic endeavours, which he rarely talks about, Russell enjoys getting up early and seizing the day. A graduate of Journalism Studies, he enjoys writing about the world around him and has been described as a ‘born story teller’. Having plied his trade in Sydney, New South Wales, and travelled extensively, Russell relishes new challenges and new horizons, with a view that the road is life. He is particularly interested in how technology can harness, protect and predict Mother Nature.'
