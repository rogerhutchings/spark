bio: 'Voted the employee most likely to survive the zombie apocalypse, Claude is a lean, mean, PR machine. Working for agencies and client side for companies such as IBM and SAS means Claude knows her Shiraz from her Malbec and her McVities from her Fox’s. It’s rumoured that petrol-head Claude can build a client’s profile faster than Vanoss speed runs. Mainly because she doesn’t wait for opportunity – she creates it. '
