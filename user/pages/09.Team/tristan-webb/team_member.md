bio: 'Whether discussing beer or PR, Tristan believes in two things: craft, and keeping it real. A former bicycle repairman and industrial manufacturer, he’s expert at getting inside the nuts and bolts of a story and helping peddle it to the media – making sure you’re never saddled with a duff coverage haul. Even though he’s based in Birmingham, Tristan is still an expert in where best to get a decent drink in Soho and Noho, and will happily extol the virtues of the Dog & Duck, The Crown & Two, or The Ship when beer o’clock comes around.'
