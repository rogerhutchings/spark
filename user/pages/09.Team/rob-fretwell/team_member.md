bio: 'A keen rower and noted cake enthusiast, Rob brings an infectious enthusiasm and drive to his account teams at Spark. With his finger on the pulse of the latest developments in technology, Rob’s eye for a story – honed during his time as Comic-Con’s blogger – consistently gets Spark’s clients into the media conversation. When he’s not busy delivering results for clients, you’ll either find Rob single-handedly getting through the office coffee supply, or finishing off his fourth barbeque of the week.'
