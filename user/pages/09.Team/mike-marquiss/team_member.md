bio: 'Many would be surprised to know Mike’s first single was the Thong Song, or that he attended Christian Rock festivals as a youth, but he is a man of many layers. With a dry wit and calming manner, Mike has the ability to get on with anyone, making him a great team leader. Mike has a thorough understanding of what makes a good story, and can quickly evaluate opportunities on the fly. He applies this knowledge to developing creative content and campaigns that achieve brilliant results… and he’s always last man standing at the end of a boozy night out. '
