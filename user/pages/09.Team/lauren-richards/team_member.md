bio: 'As the resident oldie Lauren talks up the good old days of tech launch parties for version 2.2.1 of a new product.  Although she’s secretly glad that PR is now all about creating a good story – that’s what makes each day interesting. In her spare time she tries ‘engage and influence’ her children with varying success.   She is addicted to the Houzz app but her love of interior design is theoretical rather than practical -  assembling a desk is up there with the dot.com bust as the lowpoint of starting a PR agency. '
