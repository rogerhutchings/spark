bio: 'Spark’s politics junkie, David not only binges on the latest news from Washington, Westminster or Windhoek but uses it to identify the key issues clients can respond to and lead on. When not glued to all-night election or referendum results, he is usually found delving into the background of politics, chemistry, technology or any other subject to find more information to flesh out clients’ stories. Spark’s only employee in another country, David fled London for sunny Glasgow in 2016 and has been enjoying the tropical lifestyle ever since. '
