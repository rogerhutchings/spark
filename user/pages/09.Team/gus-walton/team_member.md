bio: 'Gus is Spark’s resident class clown and is always up for a laugh; or whingeing about Robbie Williams, the use of emojis or Nicholas Cage. When he isn’t clowning around and flicking elastic bands across the office, he can be found chasing down news hijacks for his clients and securing top results in the national newspapers. Gus’ expertise lies within internet security, the retail industry and IT services. In his spare time Gus can been seen drinking at the Duke of Edinburgh in Brixton and training for the London Marathon, where it’s possible he might not make it to the finish line.'
