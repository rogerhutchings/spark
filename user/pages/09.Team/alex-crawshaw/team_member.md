last_name: Crawshaw
bio: 'Despite being old enough to remember the days of posting and faxing press releases, long-suffering Sheffield Wednesday fan, Alex definitely considers himself a digital native (even if only in spirit!).  He hasn’t gone as far as buying shares in Apple or changing his name to Alexa just yet, but Alex is Spark’s resident tech gadget geek. In his 16+ years in PR, Alex’s biggest buzz still is from achieving coverage for clients, from securing product news in a trade publication through to a feature inclusion in a national.'
