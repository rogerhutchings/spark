bio: 'At time of writing, Josh is Spark’s resident number one sports fanatic. Josh’s passion for all things football related infected the office (at the World Cup), but this energy isn’t restricted to the pitch or the stands. He has no problem launching himself into a project, even when it means battling against the odds to score a last-minute winner. Josh likes to follow the old adage that form is temporary, but class is permanent – especially when it comes to dedicating yourself to scoring PR results. As a result, he’s instituted a rigorous training regime both in and out of the office.  '
