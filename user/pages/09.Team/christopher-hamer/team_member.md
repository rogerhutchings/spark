bio: 'Chris is something of a tech geek, and when he’s not working on B2B tech PR he reviews more consumer focussed tech online. Having joined Spark in 2015, he has spent most of his career on B2B technology accounts. As such, he uses his geeky knowledge to digest and understand complex offerings from clients in order to capture journalists’ imaginations and get great results for them. He is also an avid street-art collector and can often be seen snapping photos of the latest pieces in Soho during his lunchbreak. '
