bio: 'Oli comes from a political background, where he first worked in the hustle and bustle of Westminster for a government minister and then as a public affairs executive for a charity. His experience in a fast-paced environment has made him able to see to the heart of an issue and use this to secure the minds of journalists and influencers alike. When not at Spark’s office you’ll find Oli on the rugby pitch playing wing for the Kings Cross Steelers or cycling around London to find the best latte.'
