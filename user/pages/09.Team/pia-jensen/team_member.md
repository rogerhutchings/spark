bio: 'Working day-to-day for the ‘dark side’ while burning the midnight oil as Journalism & Media undergrad. Happily uses her knowledge from professors to quickly get to the heart of a story and secure great coverage. Has told everyone she knows (repeatedly) about the time she got a client BBC website coverage because of a tweet. Tries to balance out the office’s outrageous coffee consumption with regular cups of tea and occasionally provides the team with homemade cake (for breakfast). Will claim she is the Spark employee most likely to fall over due to her lack of co-ordination.'
