first_name: Florence
last_name: Gartland
bio: 'After exchanging her career in media recruitment for the bright lights of tech PR, Flo has truly found her place at Spark. Her eyes have now been opened to the world of cybersecurity -  a once foreign concept - and in her haste to take it all in, you’ll often find her at Hack:Soho, rubbing shoulders with industry experts and getting the latest scoop on the dangers of the web. When not securing coverage for clients or reading up on the latest industry news (and the occasional bestseller), Flo spends her time planning her next getaway - recommendations are always welcome! Staying firmly out of the coffee wars, she’d much rather discuss where to get the best (and cheapest) beer in Europe!'
