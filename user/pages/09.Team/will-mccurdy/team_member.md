first_name: Will
last_name: McCurdy
bio: 'Coming from the far away shores of Northern Ireland to the bright lights of London, Will is an English Literature graduate, who has transferred his love of language from poetry to PR. A newcomer to Spark, he’s yet to pick a side in the coffee wars and remains a conscientious objector to fantasy football. When he’s not in the office he’s searching London for great gigs or volunteering for local charities.'
