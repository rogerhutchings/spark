Whether a client has worked with us for fifteen days or fifteen years they will notice the importance we place on creating a great story. Whether it’s a micro-story for responding to breaking news or a storyboard for a multi-market integrated marketing campaign, it needs to rise above the noise to engage and ultimately influence your target audience. We know how to make this happen, but don’t just take our word for it, we were voted number one for story quality in a survey of journalists by PR Week and over three quarters of our current clients were referred to us by an existing or ex-client.

We work closely with you to define the impact you expect a PR and marketing campaign to have on your business and our plans are designed to influence a change in behaviour among your target audiences. We’ve worked with clients that have the standard objectives of building reputation, supporting business growth, gearing up for acquisition or looking for more investment, as well as some of the more unusual ones such as influencing the product direction of a vendor or changing public policy.
