title: Viasat
subtitle: 'Influencing public policy and changing established perceptions of broadband'
objective: 'To create content and media platforms to present the case for satellite as an alternative means of providing broadband services, specifically for those yet to enjoy high-speed connectivity. '
story: 'Spark built a multifaceted campaign, including consumer research proving that fibre was incapable of satisfying demands for high-speed broadband and product launches showcasing how Satellite has become a truly viable alternative. These were combined with a media buddy programme – offering tailored briefings depending on journalists’ level of knowledge. For instance, some briefings discussed specific industry issues, while others introduced Satellite’s potential. Spark also gathered considerable amounts of research on broadband penetration and strategy, used primarily for supporting ViaSat’s meetings with Government to discuss public policy relating to UK broadband. This information was also invaluable for briefings, contributed articles, news hijacking, and other media outreach. Spark also worked with ViaSat on creating visibility for CSR initiatives; such as ViaSat and the European Space Agency’s joint project to fund the development of innovative applications around high-speed broadband. Lastly, Spark helped raise awareness of a major competitor’s anti-competitive practices on spectrum allocation. '
results: 'Not only has ViaSat become the go-to company for high-speed broadband comment for the ‘have-nots’, satellite is now increasingly seen as a viable alternative to fibre. The campaign secured over eighty pieces of coverage in the UK, including 17 pieces of national and business coverage. The media reached ranged from The Mail on Sunday and The Times, to Capacity and ZDNet. Penetration into individual publications was also impressive, with three pieces in both the BBC and The Financial Times. The PR campaign to raise ViaSat’s profile resulted in an invite to discussions with the UK government around its proposed Universal Service Obligation for high-speed broadband. Inroads were also made into ViaSat’s goal of influencing public policy; in addition to the government meetings, the campaign was also bought to the attention of the European Commission when The Telegraph asked the EC to comment on satellite spectrum allocation.

Challenging the established narrative of UK broadband is no easy task. When consumers think of high-speed broadband, they think only of fibre. ViaSat wanted to highlight that this was a misperception, and satellite can effectively supplement fibre: indeed that without the use of satellite technology ubiquitous high-speed broadband in the UK or worldwide is unfeasible. If that wasn’t challenge enough, ViaSat also needed to educate those in government and industry that satellite is not the expensive, complex and underperforming technology it is often portrayed as, but is in many cases the best way to provide global high-speed connectivity.
