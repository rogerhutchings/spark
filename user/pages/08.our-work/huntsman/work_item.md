title: Huntsman
subtitle: 'Letting the Data Do the Talking'
objective: 'To create a content platform to engage and influence a business audience through traditional and social media as well as online and events.'
story: 'Spark focused on building a story around the data that demonstrated the risk to business across every single vertical. Using a Freedom of Information request it was able to build authoritative data that showed who was breached (in every vertical), which sector was at most risk of a large fine and which sector was least effective at detecting unusual activity. The data was presented in multiple formats – for PR it was a press release, for events it was a keynote followed by how-to guidance, and for sales meetings it was a list of issues and a dataset for that customer’s industry.'
results: "The integrated marketing campaign delivered on its objective of raising visibility with targets in order to generate leads. The content provided the Huntsman sales and marketing teams with solid data to approach target customers in specific industries. It was the foundation of the keynote speech at their 2016 User Group event. It was also used to great effect through social media campaigns and email marketing campaigns. Lead nurturing was significantly more effective as the depth and breadth of content delivered enabled Huntsman to really test engagement and refine both their priorities and approach.  \r\n\r\nThe media activity secured thirty pieces of press coverage: from the _Sunday Times_, _Dow Jones_ and _Business Reporter_ to _IBS Journal_, _Utility Week_, _The Register_ and _Government Technology_. Two thirds of the publications also posted on their social channels.  \r\n"

For cyber security specialists it is too easy to be an ‘ambulance chaser’ and offer insights into where people went wrong each time there is a security breach. As long as a PR agency is quick to respond to security breaches then media coverage is typically guaranteed.

Huntsman wanted to take a different, more considered and more helpful, approach. While the core PR programme was delivering great coverage, even without commenting negatively on security breaches, Huntsman challenged Spark to develop a bigger impact story that would engage business and vertical audiences as well as the core IT media outlets.
