subtitle: 'From Brexit to StopFundingHate; Spark helps CIM keep a finger on the pulse'
objective: 'Increase exposure and awareness of CIM by positioning it as a trusted expert, and champion of ethical and responsible marketing, demonstrating the need for strategy and leadership. '
story: 'Spark helped CIM to insert itself into the news agenda, highlighting how the organisation supports its members in meeting the dynamic challenges of the day. Spark worked with CIM to create a trends report, identifying key events and issues marketers must be aware of in the year ahead. This report was centred on the development of two surveys examining customer expectations in relation to engagement and experience. Firstly, the need for responsible marketing to meet the needs of the new ethical consumer, and the impact of outside factors – e.g. GDPR, Brexit – on marketing strategies and investments. Second, on the growing need for stronger strategy and leadership in marketing. The data from the report on marketer’s challenges and opportunities was then built upon to create compelling content on topical debates, such as the news around brands ‘funding hate’. CIM championed customer engagement and responsible marketing through press releases, features, interviews and news hijacking.'
results: "CIM became a key player in the news agenda around marketing and customer focused issues, commenting on topical developments and being looked to as an industry expert by journalists and their readers. CIM’s report on ‘The Opportunities and Challenges for Marketers in 2017’ is the most referenced report CIM has ever produced. The project also helped to shape topics for future CIM events.\r\n\r\nFrom a coverage perspective, CIM received 47 unique pieces across four months; with multiple hits in CIM’s top three targets of The Drum, Marketing Week and Campaign. The report also struck a note at a national level, including the BBC, City A.M. and The Times, which issued pieces on topics ranging from ethical marketing, ad-tech, and customer experience."

Marketing has transformed in recent years. From the impact of digital to changing consumer buying habits and rising expectations, all within an uncertain ‘Brexit’ marketplace – the ground beneath marketers’ feet is constantly shifting. CIM tasked Spark with putting a magnifying glass on these trends. The project aimed to increasing awareness of CIM and the training it offers, while also establishing its relevance and leadership during these tumultuous times. Spark developed a content and PR programme that engaged potential and existing marketers, highlighting CIM’s ‘Chartered’ status by demonstrating dedication to responsible and ethical marketing.
