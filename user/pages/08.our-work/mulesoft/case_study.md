title: Mulesoft
subtitle: 'Integrated marketing campaign delivers 700 webinar registrations and 400 downloads in two weeks'
objective: 'Build a creative content platform that would be used for integrated marketing initiatives, from PR through to sales enablement, to highlight the true cost of the disconnect between data and systems. '
story: 'Line of business audiences pre-dominantly care about what their customers care about.  CIOs and the C-Suite need to demonstrate that projects will impact the bottom line, as well as serve internal users.  Spark therefore came up with the idea of a consumer research project, engaging Mulesoft’s prospects with insights from their customers on the impact of a disconnected experience and therefore demonstrating the business need to better connect applications.  Spark built a vertical-first campaign and the storyboard and research questions were carefully tailored for each audience.  For example, with healthcare the story focused on how patient outcomes or care had been impacted by lack of integration; for banking the story focused on how consumers would welcome Facebook or other market disruptors entering the industry; and for insurance the research revealed that consumers were prepared to share data in return for a more personalised experience.  Five individual press releases and a pan-European report were created.  '
results: 'While the story was driven by PR, seeing value across all marketing channels was key. The integrated marketing campaign was extremely successful, the report saw over 400 downloads in two weeks and is one of the most successful pieces of content on MuleSoft’s website.  There were 700 registrations for the webinar and the content was presented at xx European summits.  The UK media coverage total reached 25 pieces in the first month and included a mix of enterprise IT and vertical titles including diginomica, IT Pro, Business Insider, Internet Retailing, Post Magazine, FSTech, Financial IT and LocalGov. By providing insight directly from customers through consumer research, MuleSoft had a powerful tool for engagement that could be used in a number of different marketing campaigns in retail, insurance, banking, public sector and healthcare.  The campaign was so successful that it will be repeated annually.  '

MuleSoft’s technology offers a fundamentally different approach to connecting data and applications and solves many of the problems that have plagued the IT industry for decades. Focusing on this innovation had created interest and excitement with the IT community who saw the potential to solve a multi-million dollar integration problem.  However, this message was too technical to interest line of business audiences.  Spark was asked to put its creative skills to the test and build a story that was relevant and interesting to MuleSoft’s prospective customers in retail, insurance, banking, public sector and healthcare across core European markets.
