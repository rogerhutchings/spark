![Social networks](Social-networks.jpg)I’ll quite happily admit to signing myself up to, or downloading an iPhone app, to check out each and every new social networking fad – and in recent years there have been many of these. They say variety is the spice of life, however even I am now starting to question; are there simply too many social networks?

Over the last month or so there has been a lot of 'next Facebook' buzz around online pinboard service [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/). I, like many early adopters, signed up and set up boards of interest (any Sheffield Wednesday fans out there can check out my board [here](http://pinterest.com/crawsh23/sheffield-wednesday/)) but who knows whether I will have the same interest in the site in six months’ time.

The same can be said of my experience of other social networks over the last 12 months. I signed up to Google+ and Path ([before its recent data privacy controversy](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/feb/09/path-privacy-apps?newsfeed=true)), but after an initial burst of enthusiasm I found myself using them less and less. Even Foursquare, where I had amassed a load of mayorships and badges (which I am still proud of I’ll have you know) has seen a significant reduction of usage from me.

So despite new social networks emerging seemingly every day (hot tips currently seem to be ‘people discovery’ services such as [Highlight](http://highlig.ht/) and [Glancee](http://www.glancee.com/)), the fact is I only really remain loyal to Facebook and Twitter, with [Instagram](http://instagr.am/) being a new permanent entrant on my social networking hit parade. Maybe the problem is I simply don’t have the time these days to properly engage with social networking sites like I did in the past.   Or is it that we have reached a tipping point when it comes to social networking, as there seems to be less and less differentiation between services these days?  I can’t be the only person out there thinking it is time to go with quality over quantity, so for social networks it really will be a case of survival of the fittest.
