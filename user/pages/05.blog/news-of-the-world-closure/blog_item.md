The past few weeks have certainly been an interesting one for the media. Not so long ago it was only PRs, journalists and general media enthusiasts that bemoaned the apparently untouchable influence held by the Murdoch family and their News Corp. powerhouse. My, how quickly things can change!

A phone call to my father last week was a bizarre moment for me. As I began the usual conversational start-ups he stopped me and began berating the UK media. I listened in silence as he talked me through in fine detail ‘all this business’ with Rupert Murdoch and that ‘evil’ Rebekah Brooks. In one day (in which I can only assume he took in at least 20 hours of BBC News), my Dad had become a fully-fledged media-basher. He even swore off buying The Sun (although I have been informed he gave in after 2 days because he missed the sports pages).

Now this probably follows the same pattern of many conversations over the past couple of weeks. But what was interesting was my father’s reaction to the revelation that the News of the World would close: ‘Ah well – at least something’s been done. That’ll teach Murdoch’

Teach him what exactly? Apart from the journos who have lost their jobs, I can’t see how News Corp. has really suffered. Except maybe the PR department who are probably making their way through their 10th pack of Pro Plus right now.

The fact is, although the paper was once a huge money-maker it has been only marginally profitable in recent years and in 2010 made up a relatively small part of Murdoch’s $54 billion empire. At its peak (in 1951) circulation was around 8.4m issues sold every week but by the time its closure was announced circulation had fallen to 2.7m - one copy for every 23 people, compared to one in 6 back in ’53.

Although that still made it the UK’s most successful Sunday paper, was it perhaps time for a refresh? I wonder how many millions would buy a copy of the first ever Sun on Sunday. At a guess, I’d say more than 2.7.

News Corp. is undoubtedly PR-savvy. It knew that something had to be done and made what appeared to be a bold move. But was it really? It got rid of an, albeit much-loved (by Murdoch), title and paved the way for a more successful one which won’t carry the baggage that would have haunted the NOTW should it have survived.

So far, News Corp. has refused to comment. Maybe I’m cynical and News Corp. is genuinely sorry for its actions… but it’s worth noting that the domain name thesunonsunday.co.uk has been registered.
