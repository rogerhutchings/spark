![](bulb-40701_640-150x150.png)If you were a 90s child, you will likely remember [Cher Horowitz from Clueless](http://clueless.wikia.com/wiki/Cher_Horowitz_(film)) and her incredible quote, "AS IF!". One thing she gave us to look forward to, was that one day, we too would have a computer that helps us choose the outfit we wear. Now, 17 years later, this dream is becoming a reality with the new [Amazon Echo Look](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/amazons-new-echo-look-has-a-built-in-camera-for-style-selfies/) – it’s like Snow White's magic mirror but with 21st century functionality.

This got me thinking, did films like _Clueless_ and _Back to the Future_ give us unrealistic expectations of technology, or are advancements bringing this tech to life? Maybe one day I _will_ have Cher's wardrobe and Marty’s hover-board. It’s also interesting to consider, how will companies rise to the challenge of 90s techs becoming the real deal?

We’ve been hearing a lot about the Internet of Things (IoT), and how self-driving cars and the ‘automated home’ ([Amazon Echo](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/9/15590978/amazon-echo-show-touchscreen-price-release-date) and Google Home) are becoming a reality. This will result in [smarter homes](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/chris-mitchell/every-sound-tells-a-story_b_16510668.html) and cities, [virtual (VR)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-39785548/virtual-reality-comes-to-the-pub) and [augmented reality (AR)](https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/04/a-possible-ar-future-pokemon-go-10-and-500-glasses/) becoming mainstream and a truly inter-connected world. It is even said that the IoT will be as transformative as the Industrial Revolution and change the world around it – with more information being gathered, analysed and fed back to make the user experience better.

Consumer wants and needs are becoming more linked to technology, but it must be personalised, at one end it should be efficient, relevant and cost efficient, the [Amazon Dash](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andrex-Dash-Button/dp/B01I29IZQ6) button is the perfect example of playing to all those needs. At the other end, it must provide new and different experiences, the world of [virtual reality](http://variety.com/2017/digital/opinion/vr-virtual-reality-mainstream-entertainment-platform-1202436737/) and augmented reality is beginning to bring this to life. Over time, these will transform many existing ways of enjoying content.  With companies accelerating their tech innovation to meet customer demands, for those that fail to keep up, the impact could be substantial.

With these transformative technologies maturing, the digital revolution is in full swing and consumer desires are changing. There is no doubt that with these latest technologies, companies are adapting to make our 90s dreams a reality. As biggest global organisations – including Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Apple – throw their weight behind this tech, we should expect to see some major advancements in the near future. Perhaps Cher's wardrobe is still in sight for many of us 90s dreamers, but will it be everything that we hoped for?
