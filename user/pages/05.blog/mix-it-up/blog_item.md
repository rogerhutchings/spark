As a ‘has been’ / wannabe DJ, the concept of mixing is firmly embedded in my psyche – switching from one tune to another by controlling the pace and rhythm of each individual track ([http://tiny.cc/x0jlo](http://tiny.cc/x0jlo) - pretty good basic explanation).

I’m sure that like me, most people have accidently applied the concept of mixing to news and events, and in turn created an entirely unique take on a story. Otherwise known as a ‘[hyper-reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality)’ – somewhere my colleagues think I spend a lot of time, which is why they throw blunt instruments at me - a lot J

Doing PR in hyper-reality must be like balancing on one leg, trying to hit a moving target with a bent arrow – quite similar to me playing [Wii Sports](http://www.twitvid.com/FLQDM) (I should be banned). It’s a skill we’ve been developing for some time though (PR in hyper-reality not Wii Sports that is) and one that continues to push the boundaries of the tools and techniques of our trade.

On the one side, PR’s direct involvement with the audience can be perceived as a hindrance – a bit like those times we get a call in the office from a client’s customer who is quickly disappointed when they discover we are not tech support or sales staff. On the other side, our relationships play a central role in how a message is delivered and received – client to audience and vice versa.

Ultimately, the goal remains the same. We want to encourage more openness and dialogue between clients and their audiences. Because this openness often happens in hyper-reality, there’s a constant need to fine tune what we do, as the environment has a habit of changing quickly. Nonetheless, as any good DJ will tell you, the best mixes involve a combination of timing, track selection and the ability to know when the music should speak for itself. Probably best I shut up now :)
