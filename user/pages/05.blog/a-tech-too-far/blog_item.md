As a Tech PR, I’m all for exciting advances in technology, especially if they make mundane day-to-day tasks more convenient. To avoid queues and annoying people that feel they should be ‘polite’ and have hour-long conversations with sales staff, I’ve always opted for the self-service machines in supermarkets, banks and train stations (mainly because growing up in London, I’ve been sucked into the idea that I’m always in a rush – even when I’m not).

But recently, I’ve come across advances in technology that while they may seem practical to many people, I found quite unappealing. I recently heard about a new Oriental restaurant in Soho called [Inamo](http://www.inamo-restaurant.com/pc/) which uses an overhead projector to beam down an illustrated menu on the tables below, allowing customers to skim through the choices and click on what they want to order, which is then sent directly to the kitchen. This means the only interaction you have with another human (if dining out alone) is the staff taking you to your table. That, and of course the ‘Chef Cam’ in the restaurant that allows you to spy on the chefs cooking your meal, Big Brother style. While an interesting concept, I think this takes advances in technology a little too far. When eating out, I like to think I’m paying for the service as well as the food, and like many people, I like to interact with the waiting staff and tell them how I’d like my meal cooked or ask them what wine they’d recommend with a particular dish, etc. I think this adds a more personal touch to the experience.

I also recently registered to a new doctor’s surgery and found that instead of going to the receptionist to check-in on arrival, you’re greeted with a tablet screen which welcomes you and checks you in once you type in your name and date of birth. You then wait in a waiting room with a large screen, which calls your name, tells you what doctor you’re seeing and directs you to the right room. Going to the doctors isn’t something I look forward to at the best of times, but having a receptionist to greet you and put you at ease makes the experience less uncomfortable and provides a human touch - something I believe that technology can’t always replace.

I won’t pretend that I’m not one of the many people consumed by technology: I have my HTC glued to me at all times, am dumbfounded when people tell me they don’t use online banking, and I have recently discarded hardbacks and paperbacks for a shiny new Kindle. Technology has changed how we do many things – from communicating, cooking, and entertaining ourselves to reading, learning, and working. Over the years, every generation has complained about the advances in technology; whether it’s people like my grandma who believes that mobile phones are ‘a nuisance’, or whether it’s people like me who believe that large LCD screens that sign you in at a surgery are simply unnecessary. Like anything in life, I think the key is to find a balance between technology that provides ease and convenience and technology that takes away the personal touch from day-to-day experiences. But as this balance varies for different people, the beauty of new technology lies in our personal choices of whether we want to use it.
