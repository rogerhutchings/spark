![London](128px-London_Big_Ben_Phone_box-128x150.jpg)Last week like many Londoners, I was impressed with watching the BBC’s [“Mind The Gap: London vs the rest”](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03xhcjg/Mind_the_Gap_London_v_the_Rest_Episode_1/)  and its explanation of why London is such a hub for so many people and businesses. It was very interesting to hear facts like London is responsible for over a fifth of the country’s wealth, 42% of workers are graduates and they are 29% more productive than in other parts of the UK. While a lot was said about London being advantageous for businesses in general, this is especially true when it comes to B2B PR. While I don’t want to bash other parts of the country (especially as in our office that would be a bad idea) there are many advantages for PRs and clients in doing business in the Big Smoke that we can sometimes take for granted.

**#1 - The Press Are Here**

Media relations is at the forefront of what we do as an industry, and this is especially true at Spark, so keeping in close contact with the journalists who write about the issues that are important to our clients is a big factor. While the wonders of modern technology allow us to communicate via e-mail and the phone, nothing beats a face-to-face conversation for building a good working relationship. Since most of the country’s leading media are based in London, it makes sense that PR should also gravitate to the capital. The BBC moving broadcast services to Salford was believed by some to be the harbinger of a mass exodus for the media from London, and that PRs would inevitably have to follow suit. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t happen.

**#2 - A Note On Boozing**

There are hundreds of pubs and bars in London some of which have been around [for over 300 years](http://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/pubs/london/jamaica-wine-house). This naturally lends itself to socialising and can be a good way to informally do business. From industry networking events, through to launch parties and journalist drinks, the sheer variety of venues in close proximity to each other means if you really can’t find anywhere suitable for client drinks you probably wouldn’t have much luck organising a “drink up” in a brewery either.

**#3 - Fine Dining **

One of the perks of working in PR is that we get to go to nice restaurants relatively often - and it is officially business! Lunch briefings, ‘power breakfasts’ and client/partner dinners are all in the line of work for an average PR and London is especially good at accommodating any occasion, taste or dietary requirement. The fact that so many [Michelin star restaurants are in such a small area](http://www.viamichelin.co.uk/web/Restaurants/Restaurants-London-_-Greater_London-United_Kingdom?strLocid=31NDFhcWsxMGNOVEV1TlRFek5ERT1jTFRBdU1EZzRPVFE9), means that business meals can really be a chance to impress clients and make them that much more compelling for journalists.

**#4 - Client Face Time**

Face-to-face, as I said earlier, is often the best way to communicate and this holds true as much for clients as for journalists. The fact is that clients are busy people and often cannot justify travelling for half a day to a meeting with their PR agency. The joy of being in London, central especially, is that meeting with clients can be arranged around other appointments they have in the capital, such as attending conferences or driving new business. Being centrally located and easy to get to means you can get that all important face time with clients when time is at a premium.

**#5 - ‘The Gateway to Europe’**

As any Australian backpacker would tell you, London is the gateway to Europe. On the off chance we need to staff an impromptu face-to-face meeting with a client or attend a conference in mainland Europe, Heathrow and Eurostar means most countries are a short flight or train ride away. Also, the time difference compared to London is minimal, meaning you are more likely to get a response in the same working day, and a reassuring proportion of European press speak English as a second language.

**#6 - R & R**

Finally, PRs are an outgoing bunch and all work and no play doesn’t make for a very well rounded PR professional. PR can be a stressful job at times and London is a great place to unwind and enjoy ourselves at the evenings and weekends. A variety of museums, music venues, bars and events (like [The Great British Beer Festival](http://www.gbbf.org.uk/) that [Tris](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/author/tristan/) and [Nish](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/author/nishal/) are so fond of) are on our doorstep and can really help to refresh a tired mind after a busy week, meaning when Monday comes round again we are more enthusiastic with ideas, more engaging with journalists and ultimately deliver a better service to our clients.
