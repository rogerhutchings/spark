At Spark, we are known for our close relationships with journalists. Far from soulless press release churning machines, we have human conversations while speaking about our clients, and love to get the chance to meet key contacts in person. Recently that manifested itself in somewhat unconventional form, as we invited people to climb into large zorb-like inflatable balls and play a game of football.

We really enjoyed playing Bubble football during a Spark team day out last summer, so thought it was something worth sharing with some of the journalists we work with on a regular basis. I was delighted that some of our friends from national and trade publications responded to our rallying call and made their way to a leisure centre in Whitechapel with nothing more than a kitbag and high hopes for a fun evening.

None of us are going to get a call from Roy Hodgson to join his Euro 2016 squad, but the matches provided a good mix of pile-ups and goals, and the evening was rounded off with bubbles of a different kind at a nearby drinking establishment. It was great to put some faces to a few names, and the lines of conversation were a case in point that PRs and journalists are ultimately playing for the same team – aiming to provide interesting stories to readers.
