The day before I joined Spark I decided to take the plunge and purchase myself the new 3G iPad. My reason for buying it was simple- I am a die-hard commuter. My entire journey to work and back currently takes me three hours each day, which means that by the end of this year, I will have spent 720 hours riding back and forth on trains and various other forms of public transport.

After realising this, it occurred to me that I needed to find a better way to boost my productivity, as I've always pictured every long journey an ideal setting for getting things done rather than using it as a sanctuary for napping. Previously, I have been hindered by the performance of my archaic BlackBerry, which by today's standards, lacks the functionality and connectivity speed of a modern smartphone. I had also grown tired of lugging around hefty books and newspapers. So I knew for certain that it was time for a much needed tech upgrade.

From the first day of using my iPad, it naturally became a crossover device for all matters work and personal. I am now able to access everything I require during my day such as, emails, calendars, work-related documents and the news, all highly essential tools to keep on top of the PR game. And when I eventually succumb to switching off and seek a distraction, access to my social media accounts, my 'in progress' Amazon book collection, my music and movie collection are just a touch or finger gesture away.

What makes this different to other smartphones and devices is its allure. I receive inspiration simply from picking it up and unlocking each morning, something which is very hard to come by when you spend as much time as I do in a carriage full of sweaty commuters. It is compact; functional and well built. The modest screen is as practical as it is refreshingly clear, much nicer than reading from a phone or newspaper. Overall, it creates a sense of pleasure around the most mundane tasks like sending emails and even typing up a blog posts such as this one!

So that, in a nutshell, is why iPad has increased my productivity. The only negative that I would mention is that it repeatedly causes me to miss my station stop. But I can live with that. Well, up until the moment my battery runs out at least!
