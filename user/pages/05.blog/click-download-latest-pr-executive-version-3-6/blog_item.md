![Automation](S.H_Horikawa_–_Star_Strider_Robot_スターストライダーロボット_–_Front-1.jpg){.img-left}Former FT journalist, Tom Foremski, recently wrote a piece asking [if PR can be automated](http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2014/03/can_pr_be_automated_t.php)? It’s a bit of a head-scratcher of an article that compares how the media industry ‘has been dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world and forced to adopt [new media](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media) technologies (has it, has it really?), with PR’s apparent lack of technological prowess.

The basic premise is that PR doesn’t use technology to further itself and that PR’s use of technology extends only to ‘a [Twitter hashtag](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA) and a dashboard of likes and shares’. The upshot of which, according to Foremski is that PR can’t grow because it can’t scale; in essence, PR growth means hiring more people. Foremski thinks this is a problem that makes PR companies vulnerable as they can’t ‘automate the technologies of promotion’. Now that’s a phrase – automate the technologies of promotion. I don’t know about you but I’m picturing I-Robot-esque rows of fresh PRobots ready to bash out a press release.

Let’s look at that then, [writing a press release](http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2342240/Battle-Hardened-Journalist-Reveals-What-Makes-Press-Releases-Stand-Out). The much maligned and unloved press release that despite its own bad press is still a valuable PR tool that both journalists’ and PRs’ alike make use of. To write a good press release, you need knowledge of your client, the industry, issues affecting the industry, product knowledge, technical and often complex knowledge, and the ability to tell a story, the ability to know what resonates with human beings. You need nuance. Machines and technologies don’t understand nuance, which you’ll know all too well if you’ve ever tried to edit a document in Microsoft Word.

So I have to ask, is it such a bad thing that PR can’t grow unless more people become involved? Lest we forget the P in [PR](http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwynne/2013/04/10/what-does-a-public-relations-agency-do/) stands for public. It is all about people after all – on both sides of the fence, those communicating and those listening. The [PR world](http://news.prca.org.uk/pr-is-dead-though-the-body-is-still-twitching/) is too often accused that it’s a clone-like, drone-like industry that churns out the same out old stories that aren’t either interesting or newsworthy. Would technology do a better job? People tell stories, not machines. Besides, as any PR knows, we already have enough trouble trying to answer the ‘[what do you do for a living’](http://iworkinpr.tumblr.com/) question. I don’t want to have to start throwing automate the technologies of promotion in there as well.
