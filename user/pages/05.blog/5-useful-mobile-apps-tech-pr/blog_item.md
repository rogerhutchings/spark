![iphone-830480_640](iphone-830480_640-150x150.jpg)To coincide with me getting an iPhone 6s this week, I decided it was time to revisit the topic of mobile apps that can help you in tech PR.  My last post on the topic can be found [here](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2014/03/24/top-6-mobile-apps-tech-pr/), which coincidentally was the last time I upgraded my phone, so expect my next mobile apps blog post in about 18 months’ time :)

[**Microsoft Outlook**](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8)** – **Admittedly an email app isn’t the most exciting in the world, but the Outlook app has quickly become my default one for all work-related emails. The fact is email remains the primary communication channel in PR, so having a mobile app that you can quickly write, view, manage and delete emails while out the office is a must have.

[**OneDrive**](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=ondrive%20app%20store) – Continuing the productivity theme, cloud storage apps are a must these days.  If you want to make edits to a press release or opinion piece on the go or access saved images on the go without the pain of connecting remotely to the company server, cloud storage apps are the way to go.  They are also mighty useful for file sharing if clients or journalists have overzealous email attachment limits. My personal preference is OneDrive, but there are also honourable mentions for [Dropbox](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8), [Google Drive](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-drive-free-online-storage/id507874739?mt=8) and [Box](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/box-for-iphone-and-ipad/id290853822?mt=8).

[**Pocket**](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-save-articles-videos/id309601447?mt=8) – There is a huge amount of online news these days, so keeping track of and having time to read interesting articles can be a challenge. Pocket is a great way to bookmark articles of interest for reading later across multiple platforms. Following recent updates, the app will even save your eyesight and read the articles back to you!

[**OpenTable**](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/opentable-uk-restaurant-bookings/id564063286?mt=8) – While the days of boozy PR lunches are somewhat a thing of the past, knowing where to go for that press or client lunch is still important.  Since being a dad to two young children, my knowledge of London restaurants doesn’t go much further than Pizza Express these days, so OpenTable is mighty handy if making those all-important culinary decisions.

[**Citymapper**](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/citymapper-ultimate-real-time/id469463298?mt=8) – Working in London your working day is very much dictated by our beloved transport system, so knowing you best route around town is essential.  Citymapper is one of the best travel apps, providing users with real-time transport information to help them plan their journey.  So if the tube goes tits up, Citymapper can quickly plot your alternative route to that trade show at Olympia, or even worse Excel.

Any other suggestions for useful apps do let me know.
