![monitor-1054710_640](monitor-1054710_640-150x150.jpg){.img-left}We can all remember at least one TV appearance that has gone horribly wrong. [Paxman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwlsd8RAoqI) repeating the same question to an increasingly awkward Michael Howard. From the fictitious meltdown of [Frank Underwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE7GKvXTazE) to the all-too-real Anderson and [the Bee Gees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHa6vYq6Nyk), we all cringe at the idea of being embarrassed on live television. From a PR perspective, this means that broadcast can be a risky proposition. While briefings with newspaper journalists often happen in the presence of a PR rep who can step in and diffuse difficult situations, there is no such person in a live broadcast. Spokespeople must be able to handle any tricky questions confidently and without support.

All of that being said, it is important not to overlook the huge potential of broadcast. Company spokespeople are liberated to a degree which just isn’t the case when speaking to a newspaper or magazine journalist. While written coverage is mediated through the journalist writing the article, a live television interview gives a much greater level of freedom to speak. If there is a point that you feel needs to be made on live television, you can address it directly and, given how often a company message can get lost in the news agenda, broadcast slots, therefore, offer a golden chance to speak clearly and concisely to viewers and potential customers.

Moreover, the internet is now preserving video and audio appearances, meaning that a broadcast slot is no longer a one-off appearance on the airwaves – video streaming sites mean that clips have a lasting shelf-life online. This matters as it has been proven that the impact of seeing or hearing someone speaking as an expert is much greater than reading words on a page. [Research has found](https://www.singlegrain.com/video-marketing/just-stats-science-video-engagement/) that video is 600% more effective than print and that audiences also have stronger retention rates for videos over written content. Most importantly, business execs prefer watching video, too. Specifically, 59% of senior executives prefer video over text. And of course, we’ve all heard the headline statistic from Forrester Research that one minute of video is worth 1.8 million words.

As more information emerges about how we consume content online, the shift to video and broadcast is only going to get more pronounced. The advantages are clear, but only businesses with a clear strategy around how to master the format are going to see the full benefits. After all, nobody wants to be remembered forever as an embarrassing YouTube clip, do they?
