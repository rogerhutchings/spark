I am not sure if it is acceptable to discuss an article that is nearly three months old but I came across it and thought wow, tech PR is setting the trend for fashion PRs et al to follow and its not often you see that!

I don’t mean what we are wearing, a certain member of the Spark team’s taste in flowery shirts may never be fashionable! I am talking about what [Gideon Spanier](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/markets/article-23999123-tougher-times-for-pr-firms-in-squeezed-middle.do) calls the rise of the agile, niche player

I wasn’t the only tech PR account director to leave the Weber Shandwick empire to set up a boutique tech PR agency a decade or so ago.  But I think I am one of the few that still believe, as Mark Borkowski clearly does, that size matters.  We always tell prospective clients that we will always stay small as it means senior staff can be more hands on and more importantly we can hire selectively so that they get a team that is passionate about, as Nick Keegan puts it, results that “impact on the way people think and behave.”

So while being small means we may well benefit from the changing PR landscape by attracting more clients, we won’t grow by much in case it compromises our ethos.
