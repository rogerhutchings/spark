![](eu-1473958_640-150x150.png){.img-left}As predicted, the reality of the UK’s departure from the EU is posing a number of legal, logistical, technologic, ethical and bureaucratic headaches for more than just Whitehall.

The UK’s tech industry has out-performed the broader economy over the last decade, weathering the global crash of 2008 better than most sectors and then rebounding strongly since. Currently, the digital economy is growing at twice the rate of the wider economy, now contributing around [£97billion](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/03/22/tech-sector-growing-faster-uk-economy-72pc-investment-outside/) a year, with the UK attracting £28billion in technology investment since 2011, compared to £11billion in France and £9.3billion in Germany.

Even in the aftermath of last Summer’s Brexit vote, the UK’s tech space seems to have remained buoyant. Apple has since committed to its £9bn London HQ project; Google announced plans to hire 3,000 more people across the UK; Facebook unveiled plans to create 500 new UK jobs in 2017 and Snapchat bought its international head office to London too.

Research commissioned by [techUK](http://www.techuk.org/Brexit) at the beginning of the year revealed that British employers in digitally intensive industries are particularly reliant on overseas talent, with 45% of recent vacancies filled by foreign-born workers.

Many of the [UK’s tech bosses](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/24/uk-tech-industry-not-immune-to-brexit-trade-group-warns), most notably [Sir James Dyson](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/23/education-technology-brexit-britain-can-engineer-way-greater/), have already expressed worry about the impact of limiting access to labour markets and the movement of skilled workers will have on British technology businesses. There are “significant challenges” ahead and these were once again underlined by the [Conservative Manifesto](https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto) and election policies pertaining to business levies on foreign skilled workers.

Once the UK has left the Single Market one of the requirements for the UK’s tech sector, as well as the wider economy, will be to become more self-sufficient. And, part of the drive to become more self-sufficient from a workforce perspective must come from a continued analysis and development of the streams that feed the UK’s tech industry.

The promotion of STEM subjects are the foundation of the UK’s technology and digital economy and more must be done from an academic, governmental and corporate perspective to ensure a steady and greater flow of youngsters pursuing these vital high-tech, scientific and engineering paths into industry.

Exam results for the number of students taking [STEM A-levels](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/maths-entries-jump-at-a-level-as-pupils-embrace-academic-subjects) have seen a steady increase of more than 38,000 since 2010. Similarly, university computer sciences applications are above 100,000, and apprenticeship numbers in the tech space are significantly increasing too as more large tech brands realise the benefits of non-traditional paths into the workplace – more is still needed though.

As the winds of political change continue to bump and buffet the UK over the next two years, it means that the country is going to have to make significant efforts to become more self-sufficient in the staffing of its core industries. Where better to start, than publicising, incentivising, growing and staffing the UK’s burgeoning technology and wider economy with more home-grown talent?
