After the recent long weekend of patriotic fervour I started thinking about why the Brits should colonise social media.   When the Queen was born the UK’s economy was based on manufacturing, now its banking.   Not very inspiring is it?

So why should social media change things?  Firstly, because we have a history of great storytelling.  From the classics such as Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dickens to the current crop of Hollywood films based on books by Brits, UK talent has demonstrated time and again how to create something compelling.  We also have what is widely considered the toughest media in the world so we know how to develop a great angle on an issue. Indeed, British content is highly regarded globally but for some reason, now we have the opportunity to reach any audience and increase customer loyalty, many of our most interesting discussions and thoughts are staying behind the firewall.

Secondly, there is big money in social media and we need a profession for all our arts graduates!  Facebook IPO aside, [look](http://blogs.forrester.com/zach_hofer_shall/12-06-05-the_social_crm_arms_race_heats_up) at how much the heavyweights are paying for tiny social media companies.    But it is all very well having the capability to capture a customers every thought or move, but successfully engaging with them is dependent on content.

When it comes to guru building, thought leadership and creating topics for discussion we can conquer the world.  If you need any proof look at Sophos, a British company that has one of the most widely read [blogs](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/) in its sector.

With that, I’ll sign off. Jingoism over for another ten years!
