![GMC](GMC-300x90.jpg)We’ve just won a new client [GMC Software](http://www.gmc.net/) after a trial project. We’ll be running UK PR and supporting the rest of Europe with content, helping the company to move into new markets and target different stakeholders. With more than 1,600 clients worldwide, GMC is leading the charge in ensuring businesses can cope with digitalisation revolutionising both the way organisations communicate with their customers, and customers’ expectations of that experience. While GMC always had a strong presence in the printing industry, we won the account following a three-month trial period focused on the insurance industry: during which we created content including opinion pieces and research projects, used this to engage the insurance and technology press, and ultimately delivered coverage that got GMC noticed by insurers.

GMC’s focus is ensuring businesses can provide a single, consistent customer experience over any channel; whether that is post, phone, email or app. From claiming on motor insurance to checking your bank balance, customers demand the exact same experience whether they’re visiting in person, over post, or using any of the modern communications we take for granted. GMC Software services banking, insurance, healthcare and service providers around the world. Yet with its profile limited to the specialist printing press, key business and technology audiences were unaware of its potential.

Spark’s three-month trial proved we could help GMC elevate its message to a hard to reach vertical sector: we’re now providing full PR support across all its key audiences, with the same success.

But don’t just take our word for it. Magali Germain, senior director of field marketing EMEA at GMC Software, says: “Our main aim was to spread awareness beyond the existing printing press. Spark’s ideas, their energy, and their ability to engage with key press for the insurance audience made the final choice obvious. Since the initial period, Spark has broadened its reach to include financial, technology and marketing audiences and has demonstrated exactly the same levels of creativity, dedication, and success. We are looking forward to them building our influence even further.”
