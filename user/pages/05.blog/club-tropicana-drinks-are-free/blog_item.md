OK so anyone that knows me will tell you that I am an absolute sucker for freebies, I will actually go out of my way to get the cloud shaped stress balls, mints and pens on offer at technology industry shows. In fact if I wasn’t a self-confessed geek perhaps consumer PR might have been more of a draw…

So imagine my delight when the other day we were literally inundated with bottles and bottles of [Tropicana](http://www.tropicana.com/) of every flavour imaginable, with my favourite so far being Mango and Passionfruit. It reminded me of when I first started in PR over a decade ago and was given a free business card holder from [TNS](http://www.tnsglobal.com/) - we still use them as a research partner today. I also remember being contacted directly by an IT director who wanted to replace his worn 3Com branded t-shirt he used in the gym!

Interestingly, in today’s social media age this business development tactic is more powerful than ever before. Where previously it would have been great for targeting relevant individuals and possibly wider groups through word of mouth; with social networks like Twitter and Facebook, the possibilities are endless.

Using Tropicana as an example I have told all my friends about it (verbally and using social networks), I am obviously writing a blog post on it, and actually I think if I was going to buy a bottle of juice in the future I would more than likely choose Tropicana. Their timing was great too, just as the summer starts, and anyone will tell you I love the summer :)

So what can the PR industry learn from it? Well something for nothing definitely sells, instead of articles about what your product does and who you are, your audience wants to understand what challenges you solve and advice and tips for free. Get it right and they will be left with a lasting impression.
