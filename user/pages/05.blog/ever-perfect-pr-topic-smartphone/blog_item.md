[smartphone](smartphone1-150x150.jpg)If you work in PR you get used to seeing the same themes cropping up year after year (cloud, anyone?), and while they are not quite old-hat for us PR bods, we are certainly becoming very well-versed in them indeed. What it means in reality is that a lot of people are talking about the same thing and the same issues, so you have to work extra hard to come up with more creative and proactive ideas for clients (which obviously we’re [very good at](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2014/08/12/coverage-cup-round-fortnightly-edition/) here at Spark.)

But smartphones, well, they are just the gift that keeps on giving. Recent news from Ofcom shows they are more popular than ever with [internet use on smartphones](http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2359286/ofcom-smartphone-internet-use-growing-seven-times-faster-than-laptops-and-desktops) growing seven times faster than on laptops and desktops. And in a business sense, they are now deemed the [most important tool](http://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/22884/smartphones-deemed-most-important-tool-for-running-a-business) for running a business. Smartphones are also one of those rare B2B technologies that actually cross the business-consumer divide which makes them even more interesting to readers. So, although it sometimes feels like every business in the world is talking about smartphones and mobile devices (they probably are), their ubiquitous nature means there is always plenty of stuff for us PR folk to talk about.

Being so pervasive therefore results in the vast majority of our PR content and campaigns having a strong mobile angle. It also further opens up areas we can talk about because smartphones are so important to the business world. As a result, they give rise to lots of other, linked issues like data security; which is a shape-shifting constant companion of the smartphone. As smartphones continue to get harder, better, faster, stronger, the issues constantly change – which for PR purposes is great, as it gives rise to emerging topics such as [second-screening](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/mar/07/second-screen-tv-battle-living-room).

Smartphones are one of those technologies that we all here at Spark personally use on an hourly basis so we can get even more excited about them than normal (and we get excited about the weirdest technologies, let me tell you). The beauty of mobile is that it has so many facets we’re never short of something to say about it; like whether consumers prefer [mobile apps or mobile websites](http://www.retailtechnology.co.uk/news/4525/mobile-apps-vs-mobile-websites/), the average number of workers [using their own smartphones](http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tablets-gain-ground-in-byod-1140679), the [security of mobile wallets](http://www.thedrum.com/news/2012/04/13/mobile-wallet-announcement-european-commission-delayed-third-time), or the importance of a [mobile first](http://raconteur.net/technology/go-mobile-first-and-profits-will-follow) strategy.

So, after my paean to that perfect PR technology, it does beg the question – what’s next? Will Google Glass be the next indispensable business tool, will devices we can swallow become the next omnipresent technology or will driverless cars be the de facto vehicle on driveways around the world? Whatever the answer, it’ll certainly be fun finding out and we’ll no doubt have plenty to say about it too.
