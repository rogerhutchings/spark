There has been a lot of talk about [Big Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) over the last year or two and there is a danger that it becomes a catch all term for all that falls under the banner of storage, analytics and data warehousing. However, to me the test of whether something falls into the big data camp is how disruptive it is. Are the volume, velocity, variety and variability of the data substantially different to data you’ve dealt with before? Are you looking to do something that you never thought possible before Big Data tools came along? I recently heard somebody say, it’s all about the art of the possible with Big Data – that’s the challenge we all face. I think what he meant was that Big Data will let us disrupt business processes and models with new ways of doing things; the challenge for all of us is to think of those things.

So market education will be key. PR clearly has a role to play in this and that’s why we are very pleased to have started working with [Guavus](http://www.guavus.com/). Guavus is a provider of big data analytics solutions, targeted at CSP’s and mobile operators. After an initial 6 month contract I’m pleased to say that Guavus has signed up to an on-going PR programme with Spark.

With major telcos already signed up in the US, Guavus is looking to build its communication service provider customer base across Europe, before it expands into the enterprise market in the future.

“From the first phone call with Spark we could see that they were genuinely excited about our business. They demonstrated the strategic thinking and can do attitude that is so valuable. 6 months in, the [results](http://www.guavus.com/news-events/in-the-news/) have been fantastic, and the team continue to come up with creative ideas to keep building our thought leadership position in the market,” said Suzanne McCormac, Senior Director Marketing Communications, Guavus.
