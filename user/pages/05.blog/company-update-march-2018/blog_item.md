With the clocks now adjusted for Spring and British Summer Time, it seemed as good a time as ever to give a bit of a Spark company update.

Over the last year in addition to [Ivalua](https://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/blog/spark-communications-appointed-to-raise-ivalua-profile) we have won [MuleSoft](https://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/our-work/mulesoft), one of the biggest tech IPOs of 2017; Comparex a cloud computing specialist that works with the likes of Microsoft; and RSA Security one of the worldâ€™s leading cyber security vendors - so clearly the team has been busy! The reasons we have been so successful I think is a focus on storytelling and creating content that influences business outcomes, coupled with media results that influence target audiences. 

Our existing clients have also been expanding the remit of what we do for them with a focus on content creation. The launch of our [new website](https://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/blog/welcome-to-the-new-website-and-brand-identity) following our rebrand at the start of October has certainly contributed in part to this growth and pipeline interest.    

As a result the team has grown in numbers over the last year, with 5 new people joining, and certainly we seem to have had lots of [former recruiters join](https://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/blog/why-recruiters-make-good-prs), so if you work in recruitment and would like to get into PR do give us a bell! Our [Summer](https://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/blog/spark-summer-day-out) and [Christmas](https://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/blog/in-the-not-so-bleak-midwinter-making-and-surviving-the-spark-christmas-party) parties as usual went off with a bang followed by the inevitable hangovers. To get an idea of what it is like to join the team do check out our [Join us](https://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/join-us) page.

With success comes the need to hire and we are looking for good candidates at various levels; we have two open graduate/AE roles, and are also keen to interview SAEs and AMs. So, if you would like to join our team of 22 and a top 3 tech agency email your CV to [hello@sparkcomms.co.uk](hello@sparkcomms.co.uk).
