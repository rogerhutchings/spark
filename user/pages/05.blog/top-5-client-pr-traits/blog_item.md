![Tips](Tips-300x213.png){.img-left}Last week, we ran through some of the traits that successful tech PR pros need, but how about clients? The relationship between PR agency and client, be it a quick fling for a project or a marching down the aisle long-term retainer, is a two-way thing.

The best clients, and so those that are most successful, understand this and will work with their agencies to provide them with the knowledge they need to hit their shared objectives successfully. Here are five traits of top PR clients:

  * **Don’t be a jack of all trades**: And a master of none. You know your business and your customers better than anyone, the most successful clients know exactly what they are [qualified to comment on](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2015/02/05/test-whether-qualified-comment-technology-trend/) and don’t try to comment on every passing trend.
  * **Trust us**: We’re not doctors, but we know what we are talking about. The best clients trust their PR advisors when they give them advice and don’t just go it alone.
  * **Spend money**: Now, we're not just saying this, but PR is important – don't neglect PR and invest in it where you can, the results will pay dividends down the line.
  * **Content is king**: Very often, clients produce lots of great content internally or for sales purposes that can be useful for external PR. And then they forget to share it with their agencies! Don’t forget to send us that whitepaper.
  * **Think about what is important**: Do you want to be in the channel press, do you want to be in the tech press, do you want to be in the business press? Having [a few ideas](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2013/08/08/ensuring-pr-activity-hits-the-target/) about what outcomes you want from PR before you start is crucial.

The world of technology throws up lots of different types of clients, from small start-ups developing innovative solutions to established companies supporting customers with legacy technologies. Wherever you are on the spectrum, having or developing, these traits will ensure that the relationship you have with your PR agency is a fruitful one.
