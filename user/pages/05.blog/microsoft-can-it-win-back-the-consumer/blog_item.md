A couple of months ago [Dom](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/2013/06/console-wars-redux/) talked about the next-generation console war which is brewing. The launch [of Xbox One was criticised](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/408351/blog/divided-by-one-critics-react-to-the-new-xbox/) by many gaming experts for its new policies, including an online requirement and more restrictive sharing and used-games policies. These policies pointed towards a shift to a fully digital future and hinted at the slow death of second hand games. Of course, it turned out that its policies were just a tiny bit ahead of time and risked alienating many consumers.

So over the last few months Microsoft has been trying to win [consumers back](http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update). Many sense that Microsoft has had to sacrifice a potentially progressive view of the console industry to win back consumer support. Firstly, Microsoft announced in June that it was reversing its original policy on DRM. So gamers will now be free to share games just as they do now.  It also announced a reversal of the requirement of needing an internet connection to play offline games. Furthermore, Microsoft also reversed a decision to not to allow independent games companies to publish games on the Xbox One.

From a PR perspective Microsoft have made some positive steps in trying to win back consumers by reversing most of its new policies and offering incentives such as Kinect bundles which appeal to casual gamers. In recent weeks Microsoft has been clear that it wants Xbox One to have a broader appeal with it not just being limited to the hardcore gamers, and if Microsoft can satisfy that market then it may be happy to let Sony appeal to the hearts of core gamers — and pick up the rest of the market itself.
