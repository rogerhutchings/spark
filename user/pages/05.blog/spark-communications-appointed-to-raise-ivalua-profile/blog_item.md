We are pleased to announce that we have won a UK PR brief with [Ivalua](https://www.ivalua.com/).  The company is a global leader in cloud Spend Management solutions and works with more than 250 leading companies worldwide, including the likes of Michelin, Credit Suisse, Whirlpool, Sagemcom, Swissport, and Orange.

Companies have never been more dependent on their supply chain to deliver products and services, and they are more exposed to risk than ever before because of technology and social media. Procurement addresses this uncertainty and has evolved to become a strategic function; Ivalua is at the forefront of this shift and has a huge depth of industry knowledge and market-leading products, so we are really excited to be working with them.

We have been brought on board to build Ivalua’s profile in the UK through ongoing though-leadership and media relations activity, primarily targeting the procurement, supply chain, finance, enterprise IT and vertical media.

Alex Saric, Chief Marketing Officer at Ivalua, had the following to say about us: “We see PR as an important part of both raising Ivalua’s profile in the UK and educating the market on the full potential of technology to empower procurement leaders. Spark has demonstrated the creativity and market knowledge required to communicate how procurement can deliver ever more strategic value to organisations.”
