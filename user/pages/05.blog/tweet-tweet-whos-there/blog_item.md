I’ve come to the conclusion that with social media it can be all too easy to concentrate on the negatives when things have gone wrong.  You only have to look at a couple of the [posts](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/index.php/2011/06/beware-what-you-tweet/) that I have written for the Spark blog to confirm that is the case.  However, over the last few weeks I’ve seen a couple of instances which have shown that humility can go a long way in appeasing customers venting their frustrations over the likes of Twitter and Facebook.

A lot has been written about the recent O2 outage and indeed this was an issue that one of Spark’s clients Compuware had a strong [opinion](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/9394313/O2-fixing-network-failure.html) about. But there was also a lot of generally [positive coverage](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/12/o2-tweets?newsfeed=true) regarding how the company dealt with the crisis over Twitter, showing customers a human side in the face of a barrage of complaints.

On a more personal front after receiving what seemed like my weekly piece of junk mail from Virgin Media I tweeted [“Finally found someone who appreciates Virgin Media Junk mail”](https://twitter.com/alex_crawshaw/status/225296739756810240) with a picture of my 5 month old daughter eating the said junk mail.  This was then followed the morning afterwards with a tweet directly from @Virginmedia who replied [“Haha! Very cute =)”](https://twitter.com/virginmedia/status/225496205428391936).  It may not have stopped the barrage of junk mail just yet but it did get me thinking of Virgin Media in a much more positive light – so it is one up for their social media team.

Clearly many companies can be very heavy handed when it comes to interacting on social media; you only have to look at Yodel going directly to Twitter to try and have negative tweets [removed](http://postandparcel.info/48939/news/companies/uks-yodel-warns-off-twitter-from-defamatory-statements/) (NB. the irony being that based on recent personal experience, Yodel’s Twitter team seem to be doing a relatively good job fixing the mistakes of their delivery staff).  Like most things in life a calm (and sometimes humorous) approach is the best way forwards and in social media it isn’t any different.
