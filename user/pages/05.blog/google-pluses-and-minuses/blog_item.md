![google-Plus-icon](google-Plus-icon-150x150.png)Most of us probably can’t imagine a day without [Google](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer), but how about the poor cousin of its portfolio, [Google+?](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/06/google-plus-is-like-frankensteins-monster/) I’ve always had an interest in G+, even having faithfully signed up back in the early days when it was an invitation-only ghost town. I’ve dutifully updated [my profile](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105874666031864451262/posts) when required, made myself login every week to look active and shared the odd article. But I confess I forget it is there most of the time – what with Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, my [social network](http://www.theguardian.com/media/socialnetworking) cup runneth over. So I’ve taken a little time to reacquaint myself with G+ and have a closer look at it.

G+ does seem to be getting more popular, so what’s driving it? Well, Google being Google, its making it virtually impossible for businesses who want an [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) presence (and let’s be honest, what business doesn’t) to not be on G+. Additionally, G+ is now increasingly used for [authorship verification](http://www.business2community.com/google-plus/advice-need-google-plus-0622935), meaning you need to be on it if you want to share content/make comments etc. In fact, just this week [Google has announced](http://www.cbronline.com/news/social/youtube-changing-comments-section) that it is changing the YouTube comments section to be powered by G+. You will now need a G+ account to comment on YouTube and G+ will even decide the relevancy of your comment – unsurprisingly, if you’ve a strong G+ profile, your comment has more chance of being boosted above others. This is a move sure to drive even more G+ take up.

There is a mix of personal and private on G+ with company pages equally as prominent as personal profiles, which integrates nicely with the search results of course. G+ has a very smooth and clean interface which is easy to use, especially if you’re already a user of other [Google products](http://www.google.com/about/products/). It’s easy to re-share and to +1 (‘like’ stuff, in Facebook lexicon), which means content has a good chance of being seen by more people. Advertising is less noticeable, which makes a nice change from the other big three social networks increasingly aggressive ad strategies. You don’t even need to leave your [hashtags](http://www.hashtags.org/) behind on G+ as they are as much a feature of the site as on Twitter.

So all in all, I’d say G+ looks nice, feels nice, is easy to use and has some good features. But the biggest reason for being on G+, particularly if you work in technology PR? Well, with the increasingly integrated nature of digital communications and [technology PR](http://www.prweek.com/uk/go/technology), you’re going to miss out by not being on it. G+ is becoming an increasingly important part of good SEO practice and Google’s drive towards independently curated [editorial content](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/may/10/google-content-marketing-seo). You’ll find many publications on there, whatever your sector; from big business to niche verticals – lots of journalists, analysts and commentators too. Finally, as it grows clients are going to be asking about G+ sooner rather than later, so now is the time to get familiar with it. So, I’m giving G+ a +1, what do you think?
