![Couchbase](Couchbase-300x68.png)Digital innovation and customer experience are two of the major industry buzzwords of the day which is why we are particularly excited to win [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/), a NoSQL database, as its customers are truly changing the way we all engage with companies by using data in innovative ways. We will be running and managing PR in the UK, France and Germany, with a brief focused on storytelling and content. It is a six figure brief which will see us develop creative campaigns that drive a more business-focused narrative around the database market.

Couchbase delivers NoSQL database technology for businesses focused on digital innovation. Although databases have been around for years, NoSQL is disrupting the market: with many companies turning to Couchbase for a data platform that enables them to develop new applications that better engage consumers and employees. Its customers include LinkedIn, PayPal, Dixons, eBay, General Electric, Marriott, Ryanair and Tesco.

Couchbase chose us after a competitive pitch process, where we put forward a plan based on developing creative content to engage customers and the media alike.

Luke Whitehead, EMEA Marketing Director for Couchbase, had the following to say about working with us: “Although I’ve not worked with Spark before, I’ve admired their work with competitors in previous roles. It was clear to me that the team have the contacts and creativity that takes PR from being something that results in sporadic media coverage to something that has a tangible impact on the business. It was clear that with Spark we’d get a strong team, where everyone from the director on our account to the AE actively contribute to the programme and drive results.”
