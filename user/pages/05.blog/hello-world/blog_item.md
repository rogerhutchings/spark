Welcome to our new website.  As much as we love to talk about ourselves and why we are different to other technology PR agencies, we realise that not everyone has the time or inclination to read pages and pages of web text.  Especially now that blogging and tweeting means that everyone has become an amateur journalist/analyst.  So the new look and feel is much more streamlined, but if you want to know more, do give us a call, we are equally happy to talk about ourselves on the phone!

Many of the team will be contributing to the Spark blog, so drop by to hear our top tips on topics such as getting yourself heard in an overcrowded market, who to talk to and when in order to make best use of your budget.  While we think we can be relied on for some interesting opinions on the latest news in the worlds of technology, PR and social media, we won’t be talking about what we had for dinner last night.

As a fairly level headed bunch, the drama is sadly lacking when you compare us to Jordan, Kerry Katona et al.  The cliffhanger ending this week was whether the whiteboard marker that Sat used to write brainstorm notes on Ana’s floor to ceiling windows would actually wipe off or whether the word ROI would be outlined indefinitely.  However, if you want all this and more check out the team’s personal tweets ([www.twitter.com/sparkcomms/spark-team](http://www.twitter.com/sparkcomms/spark-team)).
