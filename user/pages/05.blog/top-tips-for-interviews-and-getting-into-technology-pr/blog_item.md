A report earlier this year claimed PR was the 5th most stressful job alongside firefighters and the [military](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2256652/Want-easy-life-Dont-firefighter-PR-exec-enlist-military-reveals-new-ranking-stressful-jobs.html#axzz2Kc3HGWHl). Given that no-one’s life is at risk I'm not sure how much I'd agree with this but that said it is certainly an exciting and varied job with a lot of potential rewards, including helping change perceptions of a company. It is that time of the year when Spark is looking to recruit a graduate to start in the summer. With that in mind I thought it would be timely to share some top tips for being successful in interviews and ultimately getting into PR.



	
  1. **Research** – I am sure it is one you have all heard before but you wouldn’t believe the amount of times we have had graduates in that have not researched Spark, by looking at the website and our clients. Taking just half an hour to do so really will make the difference and demonstrate you are enthusiastic about finding a job in PR.

	
  2. **Tailor your interview** – Don’t assume all PR is the same. Clearly doing the PR for David Beckham is going to be very different to doing it for a technology company, see [Nish’s](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/index.php/2013/01/what-it-takes-to-be-a-tech-pr-success/) and [Lauren’s](http://www.sparkcomms.co.uk/index.php/2012/11/creativity-and-tech-pr/) posts to get an idea of the differences.

	
  3. **Know what PR is** – Yes really… While we often recruit from PR courses we do also consider applicants from other degree courses such as languages and law. Just remember you are going to be asked what PR is and how it differs from advertising. Be prepared to answer in your own words and relate it back to the specific industry; for instance, look at recent technology stories you have read to be ready with examples for your interview.

	
  4. **Relax **– Don’t assume questions are intended to catch you out. For instance, when asked what things a friend would say about you, it really is as it says on the tin, i.e. likes a drink, sociable _not_ great writer, organised. The same applies to strengths and weaknesses, think beyond being a perfectionist as a weakness.

	
  5. **A little enthusiasm goes a long way** – Nothing is worse than interviewing a candidate that doesn’t seem to care. As well as preparing for the interview it is important to be enthusiastic and smile!

	
  6. **Come prepared with examples on how you have developed core skills** – Important skills for PR include writing, multi-tasking/working under pressure, working in a team and communication skills. Come prepared with examples of how you have done this at university and any work experience to date.


Overall, though the most important thing is to be yourself; relax and enjoy the interview.  Having the research behind you to back this up will demonstrate you want the job.  While contrary to popular belief PR isn’t all about parties and glamour, it can be a varied and challenging career choice.
